# Papers of Interest

As part of my role at the laboratory, I am expected to stay current on various topics related to vulnerability science. To that end, I regularly read research papers or long-form blog posts. This is a list of the papers that I have read. Some of them are great, others are fair, and some aren't worth the time. All of them, however, have helped me develop a better understanding of the field. Hopefully these are somewhat helpful to you.

The list is in roughly reverse chronological order that I've read them. Don't assume that the order indicates anything of particular import.
