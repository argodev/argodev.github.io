I'm in Redmond this week attending Microsoft's fifth annual SOA and BPM conference. It's pretty interesting so far,
and I'm intending on writing a number of different posts (one per session that I attend). For the last nine months
I've been working in the federal IT arena stationed working with a reasonably large organization. One of our current
objectives is to evaluate means of improving the governance of our processes both at the definition as well as the
execution level. The means, that I'm interested in this conference specifically from the aspect of understanding
where MSFT is going in the SOA space but also where the various partners play in the space, and working to understand
how the various tools work together to affect a workable solution.
