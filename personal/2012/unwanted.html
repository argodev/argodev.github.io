Besides the obvious health benefits, there
are less-tangible benfits such as being able to de-compress, or think through things that happened during the day and
settle them prior to arriving at home. Today was one of those days where the ride home was particularly beneficial in the
latter regard.</p>
<p>Today started well enough with a nice ride into work and some early success with a project. I popped onto twitter and, in
an attempt to foster increased interest in the special-needs
<a href="https://www.teamorphans.com/dennygillen-b2b/">adoption fundraiser my dad is running</a>, I posted the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do running shirts, Triathlon jerseys, bike kit, and orphans have in common?  <a href="http://bit.ly/RZuO1t">http://bit.ly/RZuO1t</a> <strong>#adoption #orphans</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can guess, my intent was that people would assume that there isn&#39;t an obvious connection and would click the link,
read about the fundraiser, and consider particpating. But that didn&#39;t happen. Instead, I was greated just a few minutes
later by a response that caught me quite off-guard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@argodev</strong> They are all <strong><em>unwanted</em></strong>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m still not sure I have words to express an appropriate response to that comment (although I suppose this post is a
paltry attempt). As the father of two internationally adopted children, my initial response was to reach through the
Internet and [<em>insert something spiteful here... go ahead, let your imagination run a bit</em>]. As I sit here and look at
them across the table from me, I can assure you that the word <strong><em>unwanted</em></strong> is the least appropriate adjective for them.</p>
<p>As one who has just spent 13 months as a foster parent to a medically fragile infant, who though unwanted and abused
by her birth parents, and made legally an orphan by their actions, was very much <strong><em>wanted</em></strong> by us and is <strong><em>wanted</em></strong> and
loved by her adoptive home, I can&#39;t begin to imagine the mindset behind this kind of statement.</p>
<p>I am privileged to be a friend of a family who - at great expense to themselves, and at even more disruption to their
lifestyle and family - recently celebrated the 1 year anniversary of having their down-syndrome child home with them.
A child they rescued (no, I&#39;m not being hyperbolic) from a life of isolation in a corner of a primitive orphanage in a
far away land. In light of their selflessness, I am humbled and amazed. To ask them if they <strong><em>wanted</em></strong> their son would be
nothing short of insulting.</p>
<p>In the light of a community of believers, who believe so strongly in the mandate to demonstrate Christ&#39;s love in a
tangible way by caring for those who have no earthly family that they
<a href="http://showhope.org/">raise countless thousands of dollars</a> annually to help those who <strong><em>want</em></strong> these children...</p>
<p>In the light of this <a href="http://www.togetherforadoption.org/">same community</a> who
<a href="http://www.togetherforadoption.org/?page_id=11942">gathers to encourage, equip and challenge</a> others to do the same...</p>
<p>In the light of Scripture, where our God is described as being the <a href="http://esv.to/Ps68.5"><em>Father of the Fatherless</em></a> and
as His followers we are commanded to <a href="http://esv.to/Jm1.27">visit the orphans in their affliction</a>...</p>
<p>When I consider all of this, I am left thinking that I will reply (and possibly shout):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NO! By God&#39;s grace they are not unwanted!</strong></p>
