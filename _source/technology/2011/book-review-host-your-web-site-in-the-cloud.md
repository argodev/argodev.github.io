Over the holiday break I spent some time getting ready for the
[cloud computing precompiler](http://codemash.org/Precompiler#AWS) at [CodeMash](http://codemash.org/) and as part of
that effort I read Jeff Barr’s Host Your Web Site In The Cloud, Amazon Web Services Made Easy. This book is one of the
few physical paper books I’ve gotten recently, and is unique to me in that it is the only book I have that is signed
by the author.

That aside, I’d like to recommend this book to anyone who is looking at [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/),
or would consider themselves a beginner with AWS. I found the writing style to be very easy to read and, while I’m not
a PHP developer, the code samples and walkthroughs were clear and simple to follow.

AWS is a fast moving target, and even though Jeff is on the team, I’m certain it was difficult to get a book to market
that wasn’t completely outdated by the time it hit the shelves, but I think he does a good job of addressing the
basics, providing a foundation on which you can build your knowledge, and even slips in a few notes regarding late
breaking updates (as of press time) such as EC2 instances being bootable from EBS.

In my mind, this book is similar to the
[Windows Azure Training Kit](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=413e88f8-5966-4a83-b309-53b7b77edf78&displaylang=en)
in that it gives you most everything you need to get your feed wet, get rolling with the technology, and provides you
with the framework by which you can add to your skills.
