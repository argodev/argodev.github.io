# My Blog

I am uncertain that this repository will be of particular interest to anyone - it is simply used to support my personal blog which is, primarily, a place for me to express my thoughts and work them out so I understand them better. Occasionally, someone benefits from reading the content.

This readme is designed to serve two purposes:
1. Remind me how to use the commands relative to the site
2. Provide credit to those whose code/libraries/etc. this site is based on (there's a bunch).
