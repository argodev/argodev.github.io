While some of you are aware, to others it may come as somewhat of a surprise that about a week ago I ended my tenure at
[Planet Technologies](http://go-planet.com/) after nearly 11.5 years. As I shared with some of the Planet folks in an
email, my experience at Planet was great, and I am leaving with fond memories of my time there and the people I have
been privileged to work with.

I started there as a "systems engineer" racking/stacking boxes in a colocation center. Since then, I've had the
privilege of working on a wide spectrum of projects, covering an equally broad range of technologies, and a fairly wide
customer set. I've worked on both small teams and larger teams. I've been part of the management team, and later
returned to the technical team (a better fit, I might add). I've traveled the globe, and met/worked with folks in a
number of different cultures. I'm proud to have been part of that organization - to see it grow into what is now a
world-renowned team deploying technical solutions for their customers and doing a great job at it.

Many of you know I've been working (on Planet's behalf) at the [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](http://ornl.gov/) for
a little over 4 years now and I have been given the opportunity to join the research organization in a full time
capacity. While not an easy decision, I'm excited about the new opportunities and work that lies ahead.

Officially, I'm going to be part of the Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning team, which is in the
Computational Data Analytics group within the Computational Sciences and Engineering Directorate - trust me, it
sounds stuffier than it actually is. On a daily basis, I'll be working with a number of researchers to flesh-out
ideas and prototypes of their research projects and to facilitate a marriage between the new technologies that are
being developed and the state-of-the-art commercial software tools. I'll be bringing to bear the work I've been
involved over the past few years using technical computing in the cloud, big data analytics, GPGPU's, and cyber
security research. I expect to continue to be involved in community events and am looking forward to continuing to
collaborate with many of you on various initiatives.
