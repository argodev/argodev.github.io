else is sleeping. These times are great as they allow me to reflect on how good God has been to me and my family. Today is
a little different than most mornings in that I find myself sitting near a lit Christmas tree with many presents and
stockings spread around. In just a few hours, the kids will be running around, screaming with excitement and trying very
hard to not touch anything until everyone else arrives. It will be a great day and, as a father, I enjoy little more than
seeing pure joy on the face of my children.</p>
<p>As I was sitting here thinking, I found myself convinced that I had already received the best gifts I could have this season.
The first is a simple realization that it&#39;s been just over a year (12/21/2012) since Bobby and Dakota came to live with us
and <strong><em>this</em></strong> Christmas, I am not watching two timid, uncomfortable,
I-know-I-don&#39;t-really-fit-in-and-want-to-be-somewhere-else kids, but rather see a family that - while we look different
from each other, could not be closer. To our extended family, our friends, our church family, and to God, I want to say a
hearty &quot;thank you&quot; for loving on us, helping us, and being part of helping these two boys become a full part of our family
over the past year.</p>
<p>The second gift is one that I didn&#39;t expect, and think I will sit with me for a long time. The other night we had our
just-our-family Christmas dinner and after we read the Christmas story and we were talking a little about what Christmas
was really all about, I asked each of the kids to share something they were thankful for. Erika piped up quickly with the
following:</p>
<p>&quot;I am thankful that you adopted me when i was little and gave me the best mommy and daddy and family - it was the best
family for me and I&#39;m thankful for that.&quot;</p>
<p>We often talk to the kids about how God has assembled our family in a unique way, and often express our gratefulness for
each and every person in our family, but it was incredibly special to me to hear her verbalize it in such a clear and
heart-felt way.</p>
<p>It has also caused me to think about God, and a third ever-present gift... His gift of salvation and Adoption into his
family... when I didn&#39;t know what I really needed or wanted, He adopted me into his family and gave me a gift far beyond
what I could have ever imagined.</p>
<p>God is good.... Merry Christmas from the Gillens.</p>
