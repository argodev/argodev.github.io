This has been a conflicting week.

I'm sitting on the floor in my hotel room, thinking over what today represents, what has happened this week, what
will happen this evening at just a little before 9PM, and I must admit, I don't know what to think.

On Sunday, our church family was told that our Pastor - Tom Craig - has been diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer and
has around 6 months to live. I am not nearly as good with words as others in our church (see
[here](http://zockollkids.wordpress.com/2014/06/18/we-received-shocking-news-on-sunday/) and
[here](http://barbarah.wordpress.com/2014/06/16/eternal-glories-gleam/)) but I want to say that I have been blessed to
know a number of pastors in my life, and Tom Craig is at the top of that list. He's not the most eloquent, nor does he
boast an amazing pulpit ministry - these are certainly good and used of the Lord, but in my opinion, that's not where
he shines. He shines in the background... where the rubber meets the road. Late at night, when a young family is going
through unspeakable trials and he is there to help. He's there when the guy who has been constantly struggling needs to
be reminded one more time about how much God loves him, and how much strength that brings. He's there when you know
you are doing the right thing, but need the encouragement not to give up. He reaches out to the guy who needs to hear
about Jesus, even though he will never attend "our" church. He's there in the happy times - just one day before learning
of his cancer, he visited a young couple in our church celebrating the birth of their first child. The best thing, is
that in all of this, he is neither pious nor judgemental, he does not spill platitudes or simple "comforting" words...
he points you to __*Jesus*__. To our loving Father. He reminds you of God's unfailing love... of His grace... of His
perfect way and plan - that which never changes even if we don't understand it.

And he did it again, on Sunday morning. Rather than curling up in a ball and taking some well deserved time alone, he
stood up and exalted his God. He shared the news and pointed us right to Christ. He didn't diminish the trial, but
focused rather on the God who would be glorified through it. He said, when I don't know what to say or think, I'm
thankful for a Father who has shown me what say and think. He shared Scripture with a realness that very few people
understand. I'd encourage you to [take the time to listen to the sermon](http://www.orbc4u.org/resources/sermons/recent-sermons/audio/269-applying-romans-8-to-terminal-cancer)...
you will not regret it.

But... there was something he was wearing that almost no one in that auditorium knew about. You see, 9 months ago,
one of my adopted sons gave Pastor a cheesy little bracelet and, for nearly every Sunday since, Pastor has worn that
bracelet as a reminder of the adopted, orphans and foster kids in our church and community. Over the past few years,
he and his family have been an incredible encouragement to our family as well as other families involved in this ministry.

And it is his heart for the orphan, that assures me that even though his life has been turned upside down, he is
rejoicing with us for our friends - the Walters - who are, just before 9PM this evening, returning from China with
Connie - their newly adopted daughter. Some of you may remember that a number of us
[had a little bike ride](/personal/2013/06/02/i-ride-for-connie) last summer raising funds to help Connie come home. I can't
tell you how exciting it is to see this come to pass.

If you find yourself thinking that this is an overly disjointed post - that the two topics aren't really related, let
me explain. You see, Connie's story gives me hope for Tom's story. I can't explain why God allowed Connie to live ten
years of her life, abandoned in an orphanage without a family. I can't explain why He allowed her to be born with Down
Syndrome. There is a lot of pain in Connie's life that I have no human answer for. What I *can* tell you, is that it
wasn't a mistake. I can tell you, that He is getting glory for staying true to His Word, that He loves the orphan, and
that He is getting much glory for how He has worked everything out for the Walters and Connie. I think the fact that
Connie is coming home tonight is no accident. Her story serves as a beautiful reminder to those of us so raw with emotion
from Tom's situation, that even though we don't see it now, God is writing a beautiful story, and this is just one small
chapter in it.

I was talking with a friend on Sunday and mentioned that we have the opportunity and privilege of seeing if we really
believe what we say we believe. Do we really believe that God is in control - that He makes no mistakes... sure, we say
it, but do we _live_ it? As I think of Tom and Connie tonight... I know that God is good... __*All*__ of the time. He is
the God who makes no mistakes
