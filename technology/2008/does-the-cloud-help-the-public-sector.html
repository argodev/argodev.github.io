<p>I’m here at PDC 2008 and having a rather good time attending sessions, talking with experts, speaking with vendors,
etc. It has been a pretty good conference and I’ve done a better job than previously at managing my ability to pay
attention (i.e. I don’t necessarily <em>have</em> to attend a session during every available slot, and, amazingly, there’s a
good chance that taking a break b/t will help me pay attention better at the next one…</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ve been thinking about the Windows Azure announcements and having discussions with a couple of my colleagues
and also the CIO where I’ve been working for the past couple of years and I’m left wondering what value the “cloud”
and the cloud computing platform provides me with… Don’t get me wrong… I completely get it for the consumer market…
there is huge value there, and some of my work with some non-profits and consumer-facing organizations might benefit
significantly from these services. I can even see benefits in some internal-to-the-same-business corporate scenarios,
however I think the uptake is going to be slow simply due to an unwillingness (warranted or not) for companies to
“trust” Microsoft (or Google or Amazon for that matter) with their core corporate data.</p>
<p>The problem for me, is that for the past few years I’ve been working at an institution in the US public sector… we’ve
been “pushing the envelope” a good bit and are more willing than most to adopt new technologies… but I don’t think
that I as an app architect for this organization, nor I as a citizen of this country, necessarily want us posting
federal information to “a cloud” controlled by someone other than the same federal entity… and I don’t think that this
is necessarily unique to the US federal space… I would have an equally difficult time seeing any other government
being willing to take this leap of faith.</p>
<p>However, the principals of the cloud are, in fact, very interesting… should those of us in the public sector be
banished to a life of permanent disconnectedness? I think not… What I’m leaving the conference wondering… is how does
a federal entity (for any country) provide a “safe cloud” to its users? One in which much of the
flexibility/extensibility that is provided in the “public” cloud is still available, however wherein the data and
services are completely controlled by the specific government… This, of course, brings up a number of issues… if the
given agency completely hosts/controls the “cloud” services… do they cease to be “cloud” services and simply manifest
themselves as renamed corporate services? This is certainly a possibility but then I think those of us within the
various agencies/sectors need to think of ways to broaden the scope of smaller clouds that we will be building… can
the Gov’t of India (US, Canada, or insert country name here) build a single set of “cloud” services that is available
only for use by it’s authorized agencies and still see manifested the benefits of scale, abstraction, etc. that are
being touted for the “public” cloud? Does a given government build a single cloud? or one for each agency? or some
mix in the middle? Will MSFT (or some other vendor) provide tools and platforms that not only allow you to connect to
“their” cloud, but also allow you to build your own cloud?</p><!--a(href='#{ conf.web_link }') Conference Homepage--><!--each session in conf.sessions--><!--  .row--><!--    .col-xs-11--><!--      h4 #{ session.title }--><!--      p #{ session.abstract }--><!--      if session.assets--><!--        ul--><!--          each asset in session.assets--><!--            li--><!--              a(href='#{ asset.link }') #{ asset.title }--></div></div><hr><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-sm-3"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading">Recent Posts</div><div class="panel-body"><ul><li><a href="/technology/you-cant-handle-the-truth">You Can't Handle The Truth</a></li><li><a href="/technology/codestock-2014">CodeStock 2014</a></li><li><a href="/technology/tracking-planes-on-vacation">Tracking Planes on Vacation</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading">Older Posts</div><div class="panel-body"><ul><li><a href="/technology/2014/">2014 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2013/">2013 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2012/">2012 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2011/">2011 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2010/">2010 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2009/">2009 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2008/">2008 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2007/">2007 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2006/">2006 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2005/">2005 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2004/">2004 Posts</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="container"><p class="text-muted credit"><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png"></a> This work is licensed under a<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.</p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.1.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/site.js"></script></body></html>
