<h4>Provisioning Solution Architecture – Germany</h4><p>Supported the local Microsoft office in their working with one of the largest hosting companies in Germany to develop a 
provisioning solution that implemented SOA principles and scaled to support thousands of new customers daily.</p>
<h4>Identity Management and Hosting Solution</h4><p>Worked with a large hosting company to help them implement an MIIS addition to their dedicated outsourced Exchange 
offering. Prior to our involvement, they were synchronizing the customer’s AD forest with the hosted AD forest each 
night via a series of VB scripts, LDIFDE exports and imports, and other custom code resulting in a tenuous 
synchronization environment. We helped them implement MIIS as a replacement for the custom code allowing for full 
bi-directional synchronization.</p>
<h4>Centralized Exchange Provisioning/Synchronization (EAF &amp; MIIS)</h4><p>Performed work for a US government agency in Washington DC helping them automate the provisioning of accounts in a 
centralized Exchange environment. Their model was a centralized AD forest that would host mail for all of their sub 
organizations; however their sub organizations were completely disconnected and managed their own forests (there is a 
one-way non-transitive trust such that the security principles in the sub-org forests were trusted by the “core” 
Exchange forest. Designed a solution using Microsoft’s Identity Integration Server (MIIS) to monitor the remote forests, 
and automatically trigger the provisioning of a mailbox and external reference account settings in the centralized 
forest. Also configured/customized the de-provisioning process (also triggered automatically by changes to the object 
in the remote AD environments). Finally, used MIIS to integrate with an external system responsible for assignment of 
“business card” email addresses (i.e. public address) ensuring that the GAL was updated properly with the addresses 
generated by this system.</p>
<h4>Custom Corporate Provisioning Solution</h4><p>Worked side-by-side with Microsoft Consulting Services to provide a solution for a large corporate environment 
(120K+ AD objects) that included integrating with MMS (pre-cursor to MIIS), a custom provisioning solution, contractor 
management, etc. Also featured an approval process for new accounts supporting both self-signup, and 
auto-expiration/rolloff of contractor accounts).</p>
<h4>MPF Developer Toolkit</h4><p>Built an integrated development environment for designing, building, and testing MPF namespaces, named procedures, and 
requests. This tool features the unification of a series of command-line tools and other utilities into a unified 
graphical environment including an XML editor with full Intellisense-like support. This tool was adapted and 
distributed as a tool by Microsoft to its hosting customers</p>
<h4>Analysis of Provisioning Platforms</h4><p>Performed an in-depth analysis of various provisioning platforms provided by Microsoft. The products included in this 
effort were the Microsoft Provisioning System, Microsoft BizTalk Server 2004 and Microsoft Identity Integration Server. 
A detailed report was developed to provide a listing of the provisioning capabilities of each system, the relative 
strengths and weaknesses of each platform, and an assessment of the various scenarios in which each might play a role 
in solving customer problems</p>
<h4>Microsoft Solution for Windows Based Hosting including Hosted Exchange</h4><p>Functioned as a key developer in building extensions to the Microsoft Provisioning System to support the extensions from 
the Microsoft Solution for Windows Based Hosting to include the functional requirements of the Hosted Exchange 
offerings. This work included leading a team responsible for the development of a DNS provider for Windows Server 2003 
that used WMI in .NET as well as use of .NET remoting tools. Also responsible for building tools focused on analyzing a 
network environment and properly configuring the entire environment for Hosted Exchange. During this phase of the 
project, extended the .NET base class built in the previous project to include a custom project type for Visual Studio 
.NET. Extended Visual Studio .NET to provide Intellisense capabilities during the development of MPF Named Procedures 
and requests.</p>
<h4>Microsoft Solution for Windows Based Hosting</h4><p>Functioned as a key developer in building extensions to the Microsoft Provisioning System to support the functionality 
desired by CMSU in the Microsoft Solution for Windows Based Hosting. This work included building a base class providing 
the interop layer between MPF (traditional COM) and the .NET framework allowing developers at Microsoft and around the 
world to extend MPF using any .NET-supported language. Built a SQL administration provider exposing hosting 
functionality to the provisioning framework. Built a series of XML web services that exposed the functionality in the 
MPF namespaces to the .NET framework. This effort included specific web services targeted at individual operations as 
well as a generic web service designed to support run-time integration of new named procedures.</p>
<h4>Microsoft Provisioning System, Web Management Console</h4><p>Principle developer on the Web Console portion of the Microsoft Provisioning System. MPS is a complete framework for 
provisioning various Microsoft and non-Microsoft services. The web console, in conjunction with the managed namespaces 
(also a part of MPS), is a sample interface provided as an example of how to use the framework, and can serve as a 
production tool, or as a basis for ISVs to develop their own interface. Participated as a member of a Microsoft 
development team and helped them bring a solution to market. This project involved the following items:</p>
<h4>Custom Provisioning Solution</h4><p>Worked with the Microsoft Consulting Services (MCS) office located in Tokyo, Japan to deliver a custom provisioning 
solution to one of the largest ISP/ASPs in Japan. This solution was based on the MAPS 4.0 engine, and included extending 
the engine to encompass IIS provisioning (complete with FrontPage Server Extensions) as well as DNS provisioning. Part 
of this project included onsite training of the client, as well as Tokyo-based ISV who was responsible for developing 
the user interface to sit on top of the solution we provided.</p>
