Many of you are aware that our dear friend and pastor, Tom Craig, passed away last evening. I don't have the words to express my thoughts and emotions, so I'm simply going to postpone that for now and will come back to it later.

Many of you also know that we have been planning to do a ride this Saturday, September 6th, in honor of Tom and his ministry in our lives. Over the past 24 hours we have discussed at length logistics concerning this weekend, the appropriateness of doing a ride, would people even want to do a ride, should we, shouldn't we, what would Tom want, what would Kim want, what is good for the church, what is... you get the idea.

**We have decided that we are moving forward with the ride.**

The single biggest motivating factor is that Kim feels strongly that we should. The ride will take on a more somber tone, and will be done in honor of the strength and perseverance that Tom demonstrated through his life, and especially through his struggle with cancer. Tom's ministry centered around people. As people touched by his ministry, we are going to come together, hang out, talk about Tom, Kim, the years together... we will celebrate how God has used this man in our lives, give thanks to God for that impact, and have a good time doing so.

Some have asked why we ride at all. To be honest, it started out as little more than an excuse to get people to give money to Tom and Kim. This was a worthy goal and is seen in many charity-focused athletic events around the country each weekend. Interestingly, it has become more than that. Tom - even in an event he didn't participate in - has made an impact. You see, to do a 76 mile ride, or a 27 mile ride, you have to practice some, you have to get out and train. Over the past few months, this has happened a lot. Most interesting, is that it rarely happened alone. Two or three folks, sometimes more, would get together and ride. Often, people who didn't know each other previously would meet up and ride for awhile, soon becoming friends. They would talk about Tom, the ride, the God Tom serves, what we've learned watching Tom, how he's been there for each of us... the ride, even before it has occurred, has been an instrument of encouragement, edification, and growth. The ride on Saturday will be a capstone on something that has been occurring all summer and it is a fitting tribute to Tom that we will once again, come together as (often new) friends and continue living our lives together. This almost sounds like the sense of Community that Tom stressed so often over the last few years...

__*One important note*__ is that we will *not* be having the planned cookout and celebration afterwards. This is being removed from the schedule to to the constraints of the viewing, funeral, and related events. We will have some food for the riders as they finish up the rides, but the large-scale cookout for the church family will not occur. We do hope that some would come and encourage the riders as they finish.

We understand that some who had planned to ride will not want to ride, or may be unable to due to the adjusted schedule, and we certainly understand that. We hope that many will still be able to and will join us in honoring our friend.
