Today marks my 10-year anniversary at [eQuest/Planet Technologies](http://go-planet.com/). It almost seems odd to write that… 10 years seems like a long time, and particularly to be at the same company in the Internet/Technology field.

During my tenure at Planet, I’ve had the privilege to work and cross paths with a number of great people – too many to name specifically but I do want to mention Scott Tucker, Steve Winter, and Dan Nelson. These men are passionate about their work and a pleasure to work with. I’ve also had the opportunity to hold a number of different roles ranging from “server build guy” to dev team lead, to world traveler, and now get to play around as a research scientist. The work has rarely (read: “never”) been boring and it seems like nearly every day presents another opportunity to solve a difficult challenge.

Today doesn’t represent any sort of change, or adaptation in my career path (I’ve never been particularly good at/fond of career planning). I simply am grateful for the opportunities I have had and am looking forward to what the coming years hold.
