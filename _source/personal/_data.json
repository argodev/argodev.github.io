These times are great as they allow me to reflect on how good God has been to me and my family. Today is a little different than most mornings in that I find myself sitting near a lit Christmas tree with many presents and stockings spread around. In just a few hours, the kids will be running around, screaming with excitement and trying very hard to not touch anything until everyone else arrives. It will be a great day and, as a father, I enjoy little more than seeing pure joy on the face of my children.",

Matt has grown a ton in that time... it is hard to look at pictures of that big-haired 15-month old and realize it's the same child. Now, as a six year old, he's one of the most kind kids I know. He's incredibly outgoing and friendly - always concerned about making others feel at important. At home, he's been a great brother to baby R and has welcomed both B and D into our family even though he took the brunt of the changes.",
