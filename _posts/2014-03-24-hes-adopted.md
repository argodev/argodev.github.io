description: "Community soccer brings out the best in people - almost no one (besides the soccer organizers) would make such a claim. It is true that there are many good things about teamwork, sportsmanship, physical fitness, and the like that can be learned and developed, but far too often people get in the way. Such was the case this past Friday evening. My family was watching one of my sons play soccer and, right on the other side of two of my adopted children (all four of ours joined our family via adoption) sat 'that guy'. If you’ve ever been to a game, you likely know who I’m talking about."

"Community soccer brings out the best in people" - almost no one (besides the soccer organizers) would make such a claim. It is true that there are many good things about teamwork, sportsmanship, physical fitness, and the like that can be learned and developed, but far too often people get in the way. Such was the case this past Friday evening. My family was watching one of my sons play soccer and, right on the other side of two of my adopted children (all four of ours joined our family via adoption) sat "that guy". If you've ever been to a game, you likely know who I'm talking about. The parent who, in spite of the league contract to the contrary, assumes that the Under-6 soccer event is on par competition-wise with the World Cup and, if his 5 year old kid doesn't score all of the goals, he might as well pack it up now and get his cardboard box because he is certainly bound for homelessness. Needless to say, it wasn't long into the game before it became apparent to all around that his son wasn't living up to his lofty expectations.

I usually simply groan and ignore these folks - all the while feeling badly for their kids - wondering if they will ever be able to please their Dad and understand what it is to have fun with no other objective (not that there isn't a place for competition - it's simply a matter of appropriateness and context.

But then he crossed a line that struck particularly close to home. In a fit of frustration with his son's inability to dominate the game, he decided to disavow any responsibility and yelled "He's Adopted!" - in the most pejorative tone possible.

I must admit that my first response was not a very kind one, and - frankly - wouldn't have helped anything. However, upon reflection, I returned to feeling badly for the man.

You see, he obviously doesn't understand the blessing of adoption - he doesn't understand that it is a badge of honor - a symbol that this child was not simply a result of a biological act, but was in fact chosen, sought out, desired (this is not to imply otherwise regarding natural born children but is particularly applicable in most adoption stories). He doesn't understand the value that I, as a Christian, place on that label - one that means I am no longer lost, but am placed on equal footing with Christ - I am positionally, legally, and in all other ways God's child!

Adoption is a __*badge of honor*__ - I'm glad my children didn't here or understand the meaning of the comment. I'm glad they are proud of being adopted and know how much their parents love them. I pray that they will one day be used to help many others obtain the same title.
