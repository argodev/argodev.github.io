The fourth session I attended was titled "BPM Best of Breed: Accenture, Avanade, IDS Scheer, and Microsoft -
Delivering Closed Loop BPM" and was presented by Brian Wilkinson (Accenture), Altan Enginaleve (IDS Scheer) and
Dana Kaufman (Microsoft).

The objective of this session was to do a "deep-dive" into the demo that these same folks presented during the keynote
earlier that day (which was very interesting).  What I had feared was the case, worked out to be, in fact, reality -
the demo was a bit more duct-tapped together than I had hoped. The intent of the project was to illustrate to us and
their customers what could be done ("paint the picture" if you will).

I have to admit that the ARIS platform was very intuitive and interesting, although I found myself a little turned
off by the extensive use of Java and JDBC connections (I know, I know, but I bleed blue...). As with many of the
sessions, the speakers made some general comments/points that I thought were interesting...

* Many organizations have very well documented business processes, however, those rarely reflect reality (no direct
impact on execution)

* They (as consultants and based on their experience) encourage people to avoid "as-is" process modeling and focus
more on "target" process modeling. In their experience, it is not uncommon to find that upwards of 80% of the
"process" that existed was not tied to true requirements, but rather historical, or "just because that's how we
do it" reasons. Simply focusing on what *really* needs to happen (almost ignoring for a little while how it is
currently being done) can be a great source of improvement to efficiency.

* As often is the case, the starting point is processes - processes can be documented, metrics can be understood -
this is not a technology problem. These (both processes and the metrics that you want to collect about those
processes) must be worked out prior to any "silver technology bullet" "fixing" things.
