Today started out great. Shared a room with Bobby and I think we both slept like rocks. After getting sorted a bit, I stepped outside the room, walked around the hotel and took some pictures. The little pool here is great and while standing by it, you have a good view of the nearby volcano.

{% include gallery id="gallery1" caption="Wandering around the hotel" %}

I’ve been thinking a bit about why this place seems so “cool” (vs. most of the hotels I stay at in the US), and I think that part of it is the _textures_. There is some “rough around the edges” with nearly everything, but it doesn’t look so much like a mistake, or sloppiness, but rather just “lived in” - like *for a few centuries*. There’s something to that we miss in our US suburban lives. 

SO much happened today, and it was just the first real day of the trip. We had our kick-off meeting wherein we “officially” met the Our Guatemala team. The staff started out with their history, backgrounds, and the rationale for the program - all of which was amazing and quite emotional. Then, each attendee introduced themselves and told a bit about their adoptive stories. The emotions were flowing extensively and it was clearly a helpful/productive time for all (well, at least most). It was clear how much it meant to each family to be around other families who shared such similar experiences... almost as if you've finally stumbled upon someone who speaks the same language as you do and can fully understand not only what you are saying, but also the nuiance and depth of meaning between the lines of spoken word.

We then spent the rest of the morning sorting donations and supplies for the activities tomorrow (delivering beds). It was good to see conversations and friendships forming easily amongst many of the kids (and adults). I found myself a bit amazed (in a good way) at how much some of the families brought and wondering a bit what the delivery process tomorrow might look like. Many of you might find it funny that we traveled to another country to do much the same as what we do at home with the [Compassion Closet](https://compassioncloset.com/).

{% include gallery id="gallery3" caption="Sorting Donations" %}

That done, we moved along to lunch at [Cafe Condesa/Casa del Conde](https://www.cafecondesa.com.gt/). The food was fine, but the conversations where great.

Afterwards, we went to Casa del Jade to learn a bit about how Jade is produced, how it is used, and to do a little shopping. Each of us picked out a little something to purchase to remember this part of the trip by. This done, Jackie (one of our guides and the young lady who escorted us from the airport), walked us through the park, to/through a three different markets. The first seemed very much “touristy”. The second was a normal “full” market… you could buy anything there, and it appeared that it was designed and operated to support the residents more than the tourists - which made it much more interesting to see. Finally, we saw a bit of the artisans market. Here we saw many items similar to what we saw in the first market, but it was more utilitarian in nature and again less focused on the tourist, and more on the resident. We wrapped up this part of the day with a walk back to the hotel for a few minutes of rest before we turned around for our next activity.

Our pre-dinner activity was quite unique. They brought in a barber who gives “traditional” Guatemalan haircuts and he would give an amazing hair cut for Q30 (just under $4.00). Two of the kids on the trip got cuts (including Dakota), and then three of the dads (including me) got one. In many ways, mine doesn’t look all that different, but man is it clean. He also trimmed my beard and paid attention to detail in a rather uncommon way. Definitely glad I did it.

Finally, we had a group dinner by the pool at the hotel - the official “welcome” dinner. It was again some great food surrounded by better conversation. We finally wrapped up a bit after 9 PM and headed back to our rooms to prepare for our big day of bunk beds tomorrow.
