As part of my job, I'm expected to be an expert in all things related to Vulnerability Science. The unfortunate reality is that I'm not really an expert... _at anything_. My mind appears to have a rather fixed amount of RAM and operates with an unfortunately strict adherence to the principles of a FIFO (first-in, first-out)queue. To offset this personal _feature_, I sometimes assemble collections of resources, tools, tutorials, etc. that help me remember the things I'm supposed to know and then use these to serve as a quick-access reference. This page contains links to a series of topics I'm currently exploring and attempting to deepen my understanding of. 

Depending on when you visit this page, it might look a bit... _underwhelming_. For the year 2021, I have six topics (assembly language, C/C++, reverse engineering, fuzzing, etc.) that I am working on and I will add them to this list as the pages develop. Until that time, I hope these are at least somewhat beneficial.

NOTE: I'm currently re-working this section... I hope to have it available again soon.
