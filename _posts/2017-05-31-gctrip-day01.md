When we left Knoxville it was warm and sunny. We stopped at a rest stop in Ashville, AL for a picnic lunch and enjoyed some great weather. As we drove further south, we ran into some rain but nothing too bad. If the weather clears, we'll head to the beach in the morning as we head towards New Orleans, LA by nightfall."
