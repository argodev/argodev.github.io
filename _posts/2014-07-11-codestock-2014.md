I'm pleased to have been asked to speak at at CodeStock 2014 this year. I'm giving two talks... one on Password
security, cracking and related items and another on Hiding in Plain Site. I've been able to take some time to
re-work both of these talks and extend them a bit.

Beyond the content updates, I've changed the way that I am preparing for and delivering the presentations. The key is
that everything I'm presenting is available in my github repo: (https://github.com/argodev/talks). This contains the
demos, supporting code, and the presentation source. These resources are available for anyone to use, I simply ask for
attribution if you re-use them in other scenarios.

I have also provided links to the slide share decks below. If you happened to attend these talks, please take a
moment to rate them:

* Hiding in Plain Sight (<http://speakerrate.com/talks/33971-hiding-in-plain-sight>)
