Lots of people are talking about the cloud and it is likely your boss is thinking about it (whether you know it or not). However, many questions arise as soon as you begin to talk about the cloud. How do you get there? Does it even make sense for you? Should you move all of your applications to the cloud? If not, which ones? How do you even begin? This half-day session will address these questions by giving a brief introduction to Windows Azure - the Platform as a Service offering from Microsoft - and then, using hands-on-labs and real-world samples, dig into a practical approach to migrating your applications. The session will end with a discussion on scalability and practices you should consider as you look to make your move."

          "title": "Scaling Document Clustering in the Cloud",
          "abstract": "Cloud computing has gained significant popularity over the past few years and introduces a number of new and compelling capabilities as a computational platform. Beyond the well-established benefits such as the massive scalability of both compute on demand and storage on demand, cloud computing offers the ability to think differently about the problems we are trying to solve. Rather than facing constraints of fixed limitations of a target computational platform, we are able to develop codes and algorithms that can make intelligent use of the resources available. A particular code may begin to solve a problem on a modest set of hardware and then, as the incoming data set grows or solution evolves, issue calls to the underlying cloud infrastructure to allocate the appropriate increase in hardware. The software can then reconfigure its control structures to accommodate the newly acquired hardware and resume the task of solving the problem at hand.This talk will discuss early progress in the application of the above techniques to a document clustering algorithm developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The original codes used to solve this problem utilize a memory resident non-binary tree, which causes the problem size to be limited by the amount of physical ram in the machine. The application of the cloud and the techniques described in this talk are allowing the algorithm to span multiple machines in a self-scaling, fault tolerant manner.  This talk will provide initial results, lessons learned, future work, as well as a brief comments on utilizing various cloud vendors for the same code base.",

Join us to learn the power behind these acronyms and the tools that they can provide your next project. We’ll discuss the major components, some of the trade-offs between different implementation choices (i.e. boot from S3/boot from EBS, etc.) and provide you with the opportunity to work through some labs, deploy some code, and begin to experience the Amazon cloud for yourself.

          "abstract": "We’re rushing towards pervasive, always-connected lives and augmented reality at breakneck speed, and the technology landscape is changing so fast we seldom take stock of how different our lives are – and how dependent we are on technology. Cloud computing is in its early days but holds the promise of powering the next step in the progression of human to computer interaction through the introduction of new applications and new interaction models. In this panel we’ll take a provocative look at some of the ways cloud application are changing our lives today and what the future of client plus cloud applications might hold.",

          "title": "Data and the Cloud: A Call for Improved Formats and Consistency in Data Services Supporting Scientific Research",
          "abstract": "A variety of cloud computing platforms are emerging and there exist increasing calls for research to be performed utilizing these platforms. While the computational paradigms are improving and the platforms are, in fact, becoming increasingly viable for such research, significant issues remain surrounding the usage and movement of data (specifically large data) within these environments. If cloud computing as a paradigm is to deliver on its promise of democratizing large-scale compute by serving as a natural extension of the scientific workstation, significant effort must be applied towards the issues of data locality, presentation, and interaction. This talk assumes a layman’s perspective as work is reviewed illustrating challenges encountered while attempting to move and interact with large-scale data (subsets of the CMIP3 archive) within the cloud as well as from workstations outside of the cloud. Also discussed are issues surrounding the schism that exists between data formats that would be considered “Internet friendly” and those used in a variety of scientific research and how these formats exacerbate the problems surrounding data movement.",
