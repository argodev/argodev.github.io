Today is our long travel day - we start with a bus ride from Antigua to the airport in Guatemala City. From there we fly to Atlanta, GA and then drive on to Knoxville. 

As I boarded the bus for the trip to the airport, I noticed something off with the front passenger-side wheel and wondered if it was somehow emblematic of how the day was going to go (thankfully, it wasn't).

We left the hotel around 8:30 and had a mostly uneventful drive to the hotel. We did have a slight slow-down as we had to stop at one point for about 10 minutes while the road we were on (the main route between Antigua and Guatemala City) was completely closed to allow runners in a local race to pass.

Everything at the airport went as smoothly as possible. One of my biggest concerns with this trip was that someone would get sick, and we (or some portion of us) would have to stay in country longer than expected and need to navigate all of the related issues from that. I breathed a big sigh of relief as we all boarded the plane and headed towards Atlanta.

Once on the ground in the US, it took about two hours to clear immigration, customs, and to get to our car. That done, we grabbed a late dinner and had the smoothest drive we've probably ever had between Atlanta and Knoxville.

## Finally Home

We arrived at home just after midnight. Even though our trip *technically* stretched into 11 days (or just part of the 11th), don't worry - I will not be extending this series. I did laugh a little as I walked past the laundry room the day after we returned and was reminded of a quote highlighted in a book I was reading while on the trip:

> citation "Robert Louis Stevenson" [ cite = "rls" ]
> Sooner or later everyone sits down to a banquet of consequences.

We've been away for 10 days and there's quite of bit of life to catch back up on. Gardens to clean, laundry to do, groceries to acquire (_I think Julie has particularly enjoyed not needing to plan meals for the past week_). It is this collection of "consequences" that has caused it to take me two weeks to get these posts finished. Life rolls on and it is probably harder than it should be to find time to stop and reflect on what we have experienced. The slower pace of life while on our trip was wonderful... time to contemplate, to write, to rest, to breathe. 

## What's Next?

Now that the trip is over we are already sliding back into the busyiness of "normal" life. I'm writing this from a Starbucks four states away from my home while waiting for a meeting, our two oldest are away from home for the week and school starts up at the end of next week. It is a little crazy how fast the summer has passed. As I reflect over the trip, what it's meant to me, what I've pondered while writing these posts, I got to thinking of a quote by JFK during his Thanksgiving proclamation made on November 4, 1963:

> citation "John F. Kennedy" [ cite = "jfk" ]
> As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.

Over the past ten days, we (and those we have traveled with) have been impacted in many ways. We've seen new and exciting things. We've been part of shining a light in some incredibly dark places. We've seen hard things, good things, been happy, been sad. Probably the greatest tragedy would be for us to return to our lives, look back some time down the road and find ourselves unchanged. 

As we reflect, may we adjust our behavior. May we see those marginalized and on the outskirts and invite them in. May we consider the vast wealth of both opportunities and finances we have been entrusted with and leverage those to make a difference in the world, particularly in the country of Guatemala. May we not just speak, write, click "like", share, or repost, but actually *act*.
