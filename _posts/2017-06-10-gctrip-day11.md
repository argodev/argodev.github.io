For the past few days, Julie and I have been commenting on the fact that the car hasn't seemed to have been starting like it normally did, and that it seemed eerily reminiscent of a battery failure we had experienced in a prior GMC vehicle. Well, we drove all of 300 yards from the hotel parking lot to the gas station this morning and, after filling it up, the car refused to start. Just nothing."

I'm not sure we could claim to have taken an "official" road trip if we didn't have at least one vehicle-related incident. For the past few days, Julie and I have been commenting on the fact that the car hasn't seemed to have been starting like it normally did, and that it seemed eerily reminiscent of a battery failure we had experienced in a prior GMC vehicle. Well, we drove all of 300 yards from the hotel parking lot to the gas station this morning and, after filling it up, the car refused to start. Just nothing. We were, however, incredibly blessed as:
- it happened today rather than yesterday when we were in the middle of nowhere
- we were within walking distance of an auto parts store. 
- today's schedule had plenty of slack in it so a minor delay didn't negatively affect anything.

Roughly an hour later than planned, we were on the road again with a brand new battery and a happy car.

After a stop for lunch at a picnic table in a small NM town, we arrived at the National Museum of Nuculear Science and History not long after 2 PM. I was a bit concerned the kids wouldn't like this stop, but it turned out great. We were there for about two and a half hours and got to look at a number of interesting things. It was nice to see ORNL mentioned and for my kids to see my place of employment highlighted. We also were able to walk around some of the (inert) missles and old airplanes, which made for a very interesting visit.

We topped the evening off with a great dinner at a [Columbian resturant](http://www.ajiacobistro.com/) followed by a visit to the store to pick up some spray paint for tomorrow's activities.
