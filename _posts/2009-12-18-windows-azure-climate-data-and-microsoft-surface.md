I’ve been working on moving a large collection data to, from, and around Azure 
as we are testing the data profile for scientific computing and large-scale 
experiment post-processing and, in order to verify the data we uploaded and 
processed turned out as we wanted tit to, I built a simple visualization app 
that does a real-time query against the data in Azure and displays it. 
Originally the app was built as a simple WPF desktop application, but I got to 
thinking that it would be particularly interesting on the Surface and therefore 
took a day or two to port it over. The video below is a walkthrough of the 
app – the dialog is a bit cheesy but the app is interesting as it provides a 
very tactile means of interacting with otherwise stale data.
