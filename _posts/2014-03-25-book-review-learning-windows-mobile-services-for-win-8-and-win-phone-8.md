A few weeks ago I was approached and asked if I would like to review a book on Windows Azure Mobile Services. While
I've worked with Azure from its inception, this is not an aspect of the platform that I have utilized, so I accepted -
figuring I would have the opportunity to learn about a new (to me) aspect of a service I was already quite familiar
with. I was provided with a copy of [Learning Windows Azure Mobile Services for Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8]
(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HWRTKO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00HWRTKO6&linkCode=as2&tag=robgillenblog-20)
(name is way too long) by [Geoff Webber-Cross](https://twitter.com/webbercross) and set out reading.

As I stated, I am not a professional mobile developer so I won't be criticizing Geoff for failing to properly discuss
X or the need for Y feature. Instead, I would simply offer that I found the book quite an easy read that provided a
good overview of the tools provided in the Azure toolbox supporting mobile developers. Along the way, I refined some
ideas for a few mobile apps I've been dreaming about writing (well, maybe someday). What I really appreciated is that
the book takes you step-by-step through a reasonable example and helps you (even as a new-to-mobile dev) understand
the parts and pieces for getting your solution working within the Azure cloud.

If I had to complain about anything it would be that while he did a good job explaining how to use the platform tools,
he didn't always explain why you would want to (i.e. why the mobile services were better than hosting data feeds from
your own site, etc.). In many cases, the answers to such questions should be self-evident to the informed reader, but
for the most part, this is a hands-on book and not theory laden (this should be no surprise based on the book's
tagline).

If you are interested in getting a copy for yourself, the following links should be helpful:
