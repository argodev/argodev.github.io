Earlier this year, a fellow Windows Azure MVP, [David Pallmann](http://davidpallmann.blogspot.com/#fbid=L90vC0lPHDa) wrote the [first book](http://azurehandbook.com/) in series on [Windows Azure](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/). For whatever reason, I started reading the book with a great deal of skepticism (fast moving technology, books are outdated long before they reach press, etc.) but was pleasantly surprised with the strong business relevance of this book.

In fact, Iâ€™d go so far as to say that most any consultant working in the Azure field (and other cloud fields as well) should take the time to read this book. There are a number of worksheets and thought processes that David walks through that illustrate a maturity (i.e. lack of hype) to the cloud engagement process.

Of particular interest to me were the later chapters that moved a bit away from the technology specifics and more on the reasoning behind why one would consider a move to the cloud, what should be considered, how to identify good/bad cloud application candidates, how to plan an effective pilot, etc.
