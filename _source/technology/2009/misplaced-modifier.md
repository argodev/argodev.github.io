I was on a few websites this morning (go figure) and noticed a handful of visual missteps (mostly minor). One of them
was on the Mix 09 conference page and made me chuckle a little.

On the page talking about being able to watch Mix online (<http://visitmix.com/News/Watch-MIX-Online-Ask-the-Gu>) they,
I think, are trying to encourage you to leave a comment.

Or, they really donâ€™t like me, and are simply telling me to leave.
