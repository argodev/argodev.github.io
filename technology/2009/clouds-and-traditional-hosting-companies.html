<p>I sat on a conference call yesterday wherein we discussed our thoughts on where the cloud was going and how it was
going to impact the “traditional” hoster. Our company has been working with hosters for many  years (I started in 2000
and they had been doing it before that) and have seen cycles of service come and go. It used to be that just providing
personal web + email was all you had to do to be successful. Then, the “Application Service Provider” (ASP) model
started and morphed into providing business-related services and eventually to where companies outsourced entire
portions of their infrastructure (think Hosted Exchange, Hosted CRM, Hosted OCS). Throughout much of this, however,
locality seemed important – not in reality, but in perception. The vast majority of people would choose to host their
services with a company that was close to them, or they had learned by reference from a friend or colleague.</p>
<p>As we walked through the current market directions, and in later conversations on the same topic, I’ve become more and
more convinced that unless significant changes are made, the traditional “hoster” is destined for failure. Web hosting,
data hosting, email, etc. are all being commoditized by the big boys (read Microsoft, Amazon, Google) making it almost
impossible for the small hoster to compete. I expect to see a rise in the number of white label services, and also in
the number of mixed-metaphor hosters – What I mean by this last statement is hosters who will present a unified stack
of services to their customers and while much of those services may simply be white-labeled reselling of someone else’s
services, some key aspects of the “stack” will be provided directly by the hoster. The key is specialization, or niche
services. Maybe a hoster offers a specific financial or ERP system hosted and then marries that with services from
other vendors.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the call that was interesting to me was the postulation that these hosters were looking for ways
to “get into the cloud” – I chuckled a little because they, of all people, understand the benefits of the cloud as they
have been cornerstones of such for years. They’ve built their businesses on providing “cloud” hosted services. They
understand where the margins are/are not – and know better than most that it’s all about scale. This is precisely why I
think that the existing model is in trouble – a moderate size hoster with 1000 – 5000 servers simply cannot compete
with the big three who are buying datacenter blocks in shipping container-units – each of which hold between 2000 and
4000 servers.</p>
<p>The game is changing… those who innovate and adapt will be here tomorrow to talk about it. Those who don’t, won’t.</p><!--a(href='#{ conf.web_link }') Conference Homepage--><!--each session in conf.sessions--><!--  .row--><!--    .col-xs-11--><!--      h4 #{ session.title }--><!--      p #{ session.abstract }--><!--      if session.assets--><!--        ul--><!--          each asset in session.assets--><!--            li--><!--              a(href='#{ asset.link }') #{ asset.title }--></div></div><hr><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-sm-3"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading">Recent Posts</div><div class="panel-body"><ul><li><a href="/technology/you-cant-handle-the-truth">You Can't Handle The Truth</a></li><li><a href="/technology/codestock-2014">CodeStock 2014</a></li><li><a href="/technology/tracking-planes-on-vacation">Tracking Planes on Vacation</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading">Older Posts</div><div class="panel-body"><ul><li><a href="/technology/2014/">2014 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2013/">2013 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2012/">2012 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2011/">2011 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2010/">2010 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2009/">2009 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2008/">2008 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2007/">2007 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2006/">2006 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2005/">2005 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2004/">2004 Posts</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="container"><p class="text-muted credit"><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png"></a> This work is licensed under a<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.</p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.1.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/site.js"></script></body></html>
