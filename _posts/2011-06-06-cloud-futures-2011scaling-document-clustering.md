I was honored to be able to give a talk at the Microsoft Research
[Cloud Futures 2011](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/events/cloudfutures2011/) conference this past week. I
joined a number of other researchers and academics from around the world and discussed what folks were doing with
the cloud, where issues remained, and where progress was being made. Having been in attendance at last year’s
event, I was quite pleased to see the advancements both in logistics and content… the level of material was
definitely stronger this year.

The talk I gave was on some early work we are doing in scaling a
[document clustering algorithm (Piranha)](http://aser.ornl.gov/piranha.shtml) using cloud primitives. The slide deck
is below.
