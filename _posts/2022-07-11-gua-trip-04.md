> I have to apologize for the length of this post. There are a **ton** of pictures - mostly because the day ended up being so much more than I feel I have words to convey. Unlike the other days of the trip, this day is remains unsettled for me - I'm still processing and working through what I saw and experienced this day. I only ask that as you read this page, and view these images, that you let yourself imagine a bit what it would be like to walk into these homes.

Today we get up early to travel to the backyard schools program and learn about that work. Following that, we will head out into villages and deliver beds to families who desperately need them. We will be splitting into two groups this time as we have _33 beds_ to deliver! We learned yesterday that they have delivered over 4,000 beds since they started doing this program in 2015, and we are excited to be part of that number.

Before heading out, we crossed through the tunnel to the main section of the hotel and grabbed a great breakfast along side the pool.

[The Backyard School](https://thebackyardschool.org/) is a non-profit that seeks to meet the needs of their local community in a number of different ways. As you might guess from the name, those include educational programs for both children and mothers. Through their work with these families, they have a pathway in to some homes where families are living in extreme poverty - often a small room with 4 - 5 people, a single bed and a dirt floor. This is the organization that selected the families that we would be delivering beds to. 

One of the things I really appreciated about the structure of their program is that the funds donated for each bed did not go to a large corporation that mass-produces these beds. Instead, it was paid to laborers in the local area who made the beds directly (metal workers). Then some of it went to some of the mothers who are in training at the school as their wages for sewing the bedding. The money when to address a need in a home, but along the way provided dignity and legitimate work for others in the community.

After our time at the Backyard School, we loaded up the trucks and busses and headed out. Our group was supposed to deliver 17 beds - most of them had been delivered to the homes the day prior and we would just be setting them up, but five of them we would carry in. 

The first home we visited was, in retrospect, one of the larger homes we visited, though certainly not large by any other standards. The home was a two-room metal structure and now a little boy and his sister would both have their own beds to sleep in. The thank-you notes and comments from the mother were heart-felt and moving.

{% include gallery id="gallery3" caption="House #1" %}

The second location we stopped at had three homes grouped together where we were delivering beds. With each bed, we gave a bag full of miscellaneous goods (toiletries, toys, clothes, etc.). Additionally, the younger members of our teams carried backpacks full of things to give away to basically any child they met. This gave them an active role and helped pass some of the time while others were assembling the beds.

{% include gallery id="gallery4" caption="Stop #2" %}

Three of the homes we visited during our third stop made a particular impression on me. The first was a small, one-room home nestled in the back of a long, dark hallway. The home was hot, the living conditions poor, yet there was obvious joy in that home. 

The second home reminded so much of my time in Mexico. This home was a single room on the second floor of a concrete & cinder block building. The room had *no* furnishings and - prior to our arrival - the children slept directly on the floor. This bed would serve for three - the older girl would sleep on top, and the younger would share the bottom bed with her mom. There were no doors, no windows, no plumbing. Just three and a half walls, and now a bed.

The third home took a bit of a lesson in cartography to reach. It was down one ally, through a corridor, down another ally, around the corner, etc. Once we arrived, the home was another two-room structure and while older team members assembled the bed, my youngest two played balloons with the kids who lived there. 

{% include gallery id="gallery5" caption="Stop #3" %}

It is a little difficult to explain how dark it was at our fourth stop. We worked in three different homes and each was a single room under sheets and metal with dirt floors (in two of them) and generally a single lightbulb that they didn't turn on except for *"special guests"* due to the cost of running it. Animals roamed freely, cooking was done over an open flame just outside and we had to navigate around rivulets of mud forming in the floor due to rain outside. 

{% include gallery id="gallery6" caption="Stop #4" %}

After a quick stop for lunch, we headed out for two more stops. The rain was comming down in torrents and threatening to shorten our day as some of the locations are particularly dangerous to access when the paths are muddy. Stop #5 had two homes and in the one, we were captured by the joy and excitement the children showed about getting a bed. I'm not sure we could have assembled them fast enough... they wanted to get on them right away. Seeing the joy in the mom's face coupled with the pride from the grandmother was priceless.

{% include gallery id="gallery7" caption="Stop #5" %}

The last stop was, by far, the hardest. By this time, the rain was really beginning to make our travel more difficult and to reach this home, we had to park the bus, and then hike up and then down an incredibly steep *"road"* (not sure a vehicle could really use it). Once we finally arrived, we stepped into a two-room home that had a mom and four children (two twin infants) sharing a single bed. After we assembled the bed, the mom described the domestic situation (which included abandonment) she was living in and trying to raise her family. I'm uncertain there was a dry eye as we walked out a few minutes later (though, some may have blamed it on the rain). The ride back to La Antigua was quiet - most of the team lost in their thoughts from the day.

{% include gallery id="gallery8" caption="Stop #6" %}

Back at the hotel I feel as though I've been emotionally destroyed. We delivered 16 beds and each delivery was *so fast*, it was hard to process what all was happening - including the magnitude of the situation each family we met was in. As I went back through the ~350 pictures that I took, I found myself wishing that I could have spent much more time in each home… thinking about the situation, getting to know the folks we saw, playing with the children, etc. I feel like I missed *so* much of what is really going on… It is so easy to establish a mental and emotional barrier to *protect* oneself from the depth of the situation around us - to detach ourselves from reality and think of it as *just* about assembling a bed and moving on to the next. Rather, as we saw in each situation (and particularly the last), reality is far more complex. The issues are often systemic and interwoven - the "fix" is not obvious nor straight forward. As one of the trip leaders said, today was about making a difference in the lives of some of these families and slowly changing their world one step at a time. 

After a few minutes of down-time back at the hotel, the kids wanted to go swimming so we went over to the larger pool at the hotel and hung out. Julie talked with a number of the other parents and I spent a lot of time editing and filtering the photos I had taken from the day.

Due to popular demand, the Guatemalan barber returned and gave another six hair cuts. This time Bobby got in the chair and, as you can see from the pictures, looks better than ever.

Immediately following we went to dinner at Aqua which is just about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. There we went to the roof top deck and took some pictures, after which we came down and settled into a wonderful dinner for our last evening in La Antigua.

{% include gallery id="gallery9" caption="Dinner at Aqua" %}

I commented to Julie at dinner that I found it a bit dis-jointing. Here we were in a *beautiful* resturant, eating great food, being bothered that the one of the orders was taking longer than the others to arrive… and just five hours earlier we stood in a one-room tin shack and listened to a mother share how she barely has enough to care for her children, and often has to go hungry just to ensure that they get some food… At once I both despised myself (and those with me) whilst also being incredibly grateful for what God has given us. Striking a balance between giving all, giving some, caring for your family where you are, responding to proper promptings to give/serve, *not* living in perpetual guilt... I still have no idea of how to sort that all out. I left dinner still in a bit of turmoil, but also convinced that the struggle through this turmoil was a worthy one - that I and my family would be better for it.

After dinner we gathered as a family to discuss the day - what we saw, what we felt, what that means for us, etc. It was a good discussion and I was glad to see the kids working through the mix of positive and negative emotions. We have two more days (Wednesday and Thursday) that I expect to be particularly thought-provoking as we travel to Panajachel and we will inter-mix a few down/fun days as well.
