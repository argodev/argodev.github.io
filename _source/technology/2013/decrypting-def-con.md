This talk was given by one of the head guys of the con, specifically the guy responsible for the human badge challenge.
He talked a bit about himself, the way he views the world, and gave some hints as to how one might go about solving
some of the challenges associated with the badges, the lanyards, the stickers on the floor of the con, etc.

I found it interesting that there are over 40 distinct challenges/puzzles tied up in this year's badges. Further, the
number of distinct badges is high... and it will take seeing all of them to solve all of the problems. One of his
primary goals in constructing the challenges is to force people together... to work as teams, to get to meet people,
etc.

What I appreciated the most about this talk was not the primary topic, but rather the side comments that the speaker
made... he spent some time bemoaning the state of "computer science" practiced by many - esp. those who do the
forms-over-data type work... he was being reasonable (there is work do be done, etc.) but he is concerned that we are
turning out a large cadre of developers who don't really understand the platforms that they are building on - and that
fact might have implications far into the future.

For example, to the programmer who claims he knows that computers are made op of 1's and 0's, he suggested that you
take a box of switches and "go make Pong".

He also challenged the "hackers" who spend so much time being excited about the vulnerability they discovered... he
flips the coin and asks... did you study it to find how to protect against the attack? How should it be secured? Do you
really understand what is going on? or were you just lucky to find a particular overflow string?
