# My Blog

I am uncertain that this repository will be of particular interest to anyone - it is simply used to support my personal blog which is, primarily, a place for me to express my thoughts and work them out so I understand them better. Occasionally, someone benefits from reading the content.

This readme is designed to serve two purposes:
1. Remind me how to use the commands relative to the site
2. Provide credit to those whose code/libraries/etc. this site is based on (there's a bunch).

# Lanyon

Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

## Usage

Lanyon is a theme built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setupâ€”just download and start the Jekyll server. See [the Poole usage guidelines](https://github.com/poole/poole#usage) for how to install and use Jekyll.


## Options

Lanyon includes some customizable options, typically applied via classes on the `<body>` element.


### Sidebar menu

Create a list of nav links in the sidebar by assigning each Jekyll page the correct layout in the page's [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

```
---
layout: page
title: About
---
```

**Why require a specific layout?** Jekyll will return *all* pages, including the `atom.xml`, and with an alphabetical sort order. To ensure the first link is *Home*, we exclude the `index.html` page from this list by specifying the `page` layout.
