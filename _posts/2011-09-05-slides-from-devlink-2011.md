I had the privilege of speaking at DevLink 2011 a few weeks ago in Downtown Chattanooga, TN. I have been a bit OBE (overcome by events) since I left the conference and have been unable to post my slides until now. I hope to get the videos and other materials up in the coming week or so. If you came to one of these sessions – thanks – the attendance at both was great and I appreciated the questions from the audience.
