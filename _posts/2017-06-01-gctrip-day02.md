## Beach Day! (ish)
Our original plan for today was to get up, go to the beach, spend a few hours there, have lunch, and then drive to our hotel ouside New Orleans with a brief stop at the Lunar Landing Exhibit. As soon as we left the hotel this morning, it started raining on us and a review of the weather map made it clear our beach plans were in trouble.

We chose to go ahead with our plan to drive to the beach in Biloxi as most of us had never seen the Gulf and two of us had never seen an ocean... figured we could at least see it from the car. When we got there, the weather held long enough for us to spend an hour or so playing around before the storms started building again. 

We arrived at the Lunar Landing Exhibit at noon and realized that the exhibit was colocated with a rather nice rest stop. Given it was noon, we spent some time at the exhibit and then had a very pleasant lunch - the sun was out and there was a nice breeze.

Since we finished early at the beach, we decided to stop at the Old US Mint in downtown New Orleans on a tip from a friend that it would be an interesting place for the kids. On the way, we got diverted off I-10 due to an accident and ended up being routed through some rather rough parts of east NOLA. It was both fascinating and sad to see piles of furniture and other trash that was still piled up along the road from hurricane Katrina. More interesting was that we drove right past the old Six Flags park that sat under 4-feet of water for a month after Katrina and was permanently shuttered and simply abandonded... looked like a gost town. As we drove on, we saw many destroyed buildings that didn't appear to have been touched... almost as if the water had just receeded. A friend who used to live here said the East side was somewhat of a Katrina Time Capsule... simply untouched since the flood.

The Mint was quite interesting and we learned that the building also houses a Jazz Museum. We were able to see a number of intersting exhibits and the kids enjoyed our time there. Afterwards, we walked through parts of the French Quarter, examined some flood walls, watched a couple of freighters manuver down the channel assisted by tugboats and then headed on to the hotel.

Dinner was at a place called Chef Ron's Gumbo Shop - we picked it due to recommendations that it was "authentic" as well as kid friendly and we were not disappointed. The food was great and everyone loved their meals - we would highly recommend it.
