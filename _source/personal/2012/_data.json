Not for respite care, or a temporary placement this time, but as long as they need it. Today is also the night we celebrate our family Christmas before we start traveling to visit others… this seems somehow fitting.",

    "excerpt": "Those of you who know me know that I frequently ride my bike to and from work. Besides the obvious health benefits, there are less-tangible benfits such as being able to de-compress, or think through things that happened during the day and settle them prior to arriving at home. Today was one of those days where the ride home was particularly beneficial in the latter regard.",
