As part of my role at the laboratory, I am expected to stay current on various topics related to vulnerability science. To that end, I regularly read research papers or long-form blog posts. This is a list of the papers that I have read. Some of them are great, others are fair, and some aren't worth the time. All of them, however, have helped me develop a better understanding of the field. Hopefully these are somewhat helpful to you. 

Admittedly, there is some randomness to this list... sometimes, someone will suggest something that catches my eye for a little while, after which I set it aside. Sometimes I'm asked to read just enough about a topic to be able to discuss it intelligently. Sometimes, I chase rabbits. 

The list is in roughly reverse chronological order that I've read them. Don't assume that the order indicates anything of particular import.

## Books

I read a fair number of books (40+/year for the last decade). I skim and start a good deal more. This is a list of books that are related in some tangential way to vulnerability science research that, for better or worse, I have made it all the way through. Maybe some of them will be intersting.
