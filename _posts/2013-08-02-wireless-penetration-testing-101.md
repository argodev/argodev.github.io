I attended this session as my last of the day, and honestly didn't expect much. As some of you know, I have spoken on wireless pen testing a handful of times, have done some training and certification work, and generally feel like I know the basics fairly well.

I was pleasantly surprised to walk out having picked up a number of small, but useful tips/tricks.

1. [http://wigle.net](http://wigle.net) - an interesting site that I may contribute to as a result of my "research" driving
2. airdrop-ng: a program used for targeted, rule-based deauthentication of users.
3. Espoused the benefits of a three-card setup for wireless pentesting... I think I'm going to spend some more time discussing this with them.
4. As they should, they stressed the importance of having clear rules of engagement defined ahead of time, and the use of one card for pure logging/defense of what you did/didn't do.
5. airgraph-ng: a tool for generating graphs of what you are/are not seeing in the air.
6. Practice, Practice, Practice! - I like this point as I learned it the hard way... testing RF stuff is challenging, and the tools can be confusing... practice repeatedly, know your gear, know your setup.
7. Precision - also something I appreciated was their focus on precision... it is easy to spray & pray when it comes to wifi testing, but it is a different thing altogether to very selectively target a network/client set in an RF-heavy environment.

There was also some conversation around studying other RF protocols such as zigbee, bluetooth, amateur radio, etc... hoping to learn more on this topic in Day 1's talk on RF.
