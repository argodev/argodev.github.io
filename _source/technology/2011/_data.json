    "excerpt": "If you’ve done much work with BackTrack and wireless penetration testing you’re likely using (or at least have heard of) the Alfa AWUS036H . If you haven’t, it is simply a USB-connected wireless adapter that supports long range, various external antennas, has built-in driver support in BackTrack, and supports the all-important (for this type of work) monitor mode.",

    "excerpt": "This past weekend I had the honor of giving a talk at CodeStock 2011 here in Knoxville. This was the third year I’ve participated in this conference and I really enjoy it. I decided to “step out” a bit and do a talk that was a bit outside of my norm and tackle a topic of interest to me – GPU computing. The talk seemed to go OK, and there was some good conversation in the room.",
