## Password Cracking

There's a ton of work occuring in the password cracking space. In general, however, the problem is pretty simple. Given a hash of the password (and hopefully the salt), try a number of different values (with mutations) to see if you can create the same hash. If you do, then you know the original password. In this way, it isn't so much about _cracking_ the password as it is about _guessing_ it. 

I've tried a few tools and will document here some notes on using them. This is _not_ a definitive list, and there are many other approaches. These are just the ones I've used.

### Examples

First, we need some safe examples to play with. The first example uses the older-style MD5 based BSD password algorithm that is used by some older/more limited variants of linux. You can see them stored in `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/shadow` in the form of `$1$user_specifc_salt$user_password_hash` where the `$` is the delimiter and the magic value of `1` indicates the MD5-based hash in the form of salt, password. In more modern systems you might see magic values of `6` which indicates a __sha-512__ based hash.

Thankfully, we can easily recreate an example hash as follows:

```bash
# given: user-specific salt of "mysalthere"
# given: user password of "pass1word"
# 
# create the hash version
$ openssl passwd -1 -salt mysalthere pass1word
$1$mysalthe$CzBJwN4eH504pWE9/g8ug.


```
### HashCat



**Pro-Tip:** If you want to keep an eye on your NVIDIA GPUs while they are busy cracking passwords, you can get the equivalent of `htop` running a command similar to the following: `$ watch -d -n 0.5 nvidia-smi`. In this case it runs the `nvidia-smi` utility every half second (`-n 0.5`), leaves it "in place" (`watch`) (so your screen isn't constantly scrolling) and higlights the values that change between refreshes (`-d`)
