## Swamp Visit/Afternoon Drive
Today was a split day between a tour of the New Orleans swamps and driving. I have to say, the morning tour was far more interesting than I had expected. We arrived at the venue early only to find a number of boats being prepared and a tourbus disgoring a large group of retirement-age visitors. The tourbus group must have had a prior arrangment with the swamp tour company as they were quickly settled on to one of the boats and on their way. Our group started right at 9:30 with about 30 people on the boat which left quite a bit of extra space which was very nice for the rest of the tour.

Finally, we arrived on the far side of in Houston, TX after dealing with a bit of rush hour traffic. Dinner was at Maggiano's - a resturant we don't have in Knoxville and one that both my wife and daughter particularly enjoy. Wrapped up the day with laundry at the hotel and looking forward to a lighter drive day tomorrow.
