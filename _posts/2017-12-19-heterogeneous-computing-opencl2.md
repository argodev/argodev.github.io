I've been looking into heterogeneous computing for quite a while and trying to wrap my head around various programming paradigms. While many are interested primarily in CPU + GPU programming, I have been intrested in additional accelerator types such as FPGAs, DSPs, etc. (in concert with GPU and CPU).

As part of my research into this area, I did a full walk-through of a book on this topic - _Heterogeneous Computing with OpenCL2_. The book is [available on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2um3Sl8). My full write-up (chapter-by-chapter with comments and source code) is [available on my github repo](https://github.com/argodev/learn/tree/master/books/heterogeneous_computing_opencl2).
