    "excerpt": "This week I spent a few days in Dallas, TX at the Crimes Against Children conference. I started to say \"I was privileged to attend…\" but I'm not certain that imparts the appropriate gravity to the conference. This week wasn't a party. It wasn't a \"good time\". It wasn't fun. It was work. Hard work. I found myself having to force myself to attend the sessions."

    "excerpt": "We spent the past week with our extended family at a cabin in the TN mountains. We do this every year or so, and - as we normally do - we had a blast. On one of our \"in\" days, I had planned to work through an experiment with the kids to show the difference between the stock antenna for tracking airplanes via ADS-B and a custom-built antenna. We followed a number of online tutorials and used a bunch of open source software. I have posted below are the links for some of these tools and parts in case you want to do the same with your kids. I hope you have as much fun as we did!"

So, let's get the facts out.",

This perception might be, however, just from my lack of true understanding of how this is all supposed to work and the associated terminology.",
