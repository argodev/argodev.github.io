## Walking Around the Hotel

Today is our day with Jose Miguel. We woke up to a beautiful view from our balcony and then headed to breakfast before catching a boat. The plan is to cross the lake to the town where Jose Miguel lives and he will introduce us to the work he is doing there.

{% include gallery id="gallery1" caption="Pictures around Hotel Atitlan" %}

## Trip to Santiago

We didn't quite get off when we had hoped, but by 9:15 we had loaded into the boats and were scooting across the lake. The boats were essentially water taxis that were fairly low to the water with a decent view. The ride was probably 20-25 minutes and the views were amazing. I took some pictures but they clearly don’t do justice to the view.

{% include gallery id="gallery2" caption="Traveling to Santiago" %}

## Walking through Town

Arriving at the other side, Jose Miguel gave an introduction and welcome to the area including an overview of what was to come. After a rather interesting walk down a path that wound through a number of gardens, yards, and around homes, we climbed up to a soccer field for a few hours of games. 

{% include gallery id="gallery3" caption="Walking through town" %}

## Soccer

We played a number of different rounds with/against some of the older kids that Jose Miguel works with. They do a number of things, one of which is to use sports (primarily soccer) to give the boys something to do that doesn’t involve drugs, gangs, or other similar behaviors. It seems a bit funny that we could serve these kids simply by playing some soccer, but it is part of the program and *we had a blast*. There were a number of odd things… one of which is that we walked through incredibly poor, rural farms and garden patches, past rough homes that have quite little, to turn a corner and find right in the middle of the gardens, a fenced-in soccer pitch that has artificial turf. Additionally we were playing soccer with kids from  extreme poverty, on this fairly nice pitch, in the middle of field of all sorts of vegetables, with an amazingly beautiful background of the Atitlan volcano. It really couldn’t have been nicer. They even got the dads out for a bit and I got to revisit some of my high school days as a keeper.

## Social Programs

After the soccer game we walked a few blocks to a complex where Jose Miguel and his family offer many of their social programs. While there, they walked us through a few of them which include a library where they teach children to read, a technology center/computer lab where they use the DuoLingo application to help teach not only English, but also to reinforce their Spanish. This sounds funny but in this village, Spanish is not their first language. They also have a program where they teach the moms (of the boys we met during our soccer game) to use modern sewing techniques to provide income. They stressed, however, that they were doing so in a way as to *not* demean or reduce the use of the traditional means of weaving materials. They don’t want to lose or reduce the history/culture, but simply provide an alternate means of income. They then treated us to an amazing lunch cooked and prepared by some of the ladies they work with.

## Basketball

Later, as we made our way back towards the boats, we stopped for a game of pick-up basketball. It was fun to watch the group play as the kids of bonded well and simply enjoyed being around each other. 

{% include gallery id="gallery6" caption="Basketball break and heading back" %}

During the boat ride back across the lake, the waves got quite high (a storm was blowing in) and we had to re-shuffle seating a few times (bringing people out of the bow and into safer locations). Unloading at the pier was interesting as the boat, pier, and people were rocking significantly. We joked that it was all part of the adventure and no one was hurt or injured.

## Swimming

Back at the hotel, we had group time in the pool and hot tub. I sat on the side, working through my thoughts I found myself thrilled that the kids (from all of the families) were getting along so well and seemed to truly enjoy being together. I also enjoyed watching the other parents interact not only with their children, but also ours.

## Dinner

Dinner this evening is supposed to be a family affair and intentionally *not* a group event. A number of the teens gathered to have dinner together and the rest of the group split into smaller groups for some down time.

There *was* a bit of drama this afternoon - and it was (in the end) a good thing. For the first time (probably in all of their lives), some of the white, American-born children in the group found themselves experiencing a little bit of race-based exclusion. Without really trying, the Guatemalan adoptees in the group huddled up for some time with just themselves, and some of the white kids in the group felt quite out of place. Adding to the fact that they were already uncomfortable due to language issues and the general “most people here don’t look like me” issues, we had a bit of a bubbling over. However, as most things like this, it was not really a surprise (though the details are nearly always unexpected), and in the end, I’m grateful as it led to some good conversations.

Tomorrow we head to San Juan for our "Day with Dina" and some shopping - it should be a great day.
