I was on a few websites this morning (go figure) and noticed a handful of visual missteps (mostly minor). One of them was on the Mix 09 conference page and made me chuckle a little.

On the page talking about being able to watch [Mix online](http://visitmix.com/News/Watch-MIX-Online-Ask-the-Gu) they, _I think_, are trying to encourage you to leave a comment.

Or, they really donâ€™t like me, and are simply telling me to __leave__.
