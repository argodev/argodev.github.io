I am once again conflicted as I sit down to write. This is a post that I never would have wanted to write, but – at the same time – I am quite proud to be able to be a small part of something in honor of a man and familyI greatly respect.

Many of you are aware that our Pastor – Tom Craig – was recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Initially, this devastated our church family. However, not long after learning of his cancer, we watched a man do what he has always done… minister to the people around him. He is sharing his trial – the pain, lessons, good times, bad times, everything – with those he cares about. Not for the purpose of saddening them, but rather showing them (well... us) how good our God is in all of this. How *His* Name can be glorified even when we don’t understand what or why things are happening.

As a small token of our appreciation for his years of people-focused ministry, as well as an attempt to be a blessing to him and his family, we are putting together a fund-raiser for the Craigs and are once again proud to partner with the I Do It For Foundation (<http://idoitfor.org>).

## The Plan

On September 6th, at 8:30 in the morning, we will have two rides leave the parking lot of Oak Ridge Baptist Church. One group will be heading out on a [70 mile figure-8 course](http://www.strava.com/routes/522343) while the second group will be tackling a [more accessible 27 mile route](http://www.strava.com/routes/555384) (provided sufficient interest). Our plan is to have a post-ride celebration at the church that afternoon – with everyone invited. The rides will be supported with aid stations and SAG support.

## What Can You Do?

__Give__: We want to raise $25,000 to help them through the myriad of expenses coming up in the next few months. This is the point of the effort and we hope you will join us in this. Normally I feel badly about being this forward when it comes to money, but I love these folks, and will do whatever I can to help them get the help they need: <https://www.idoitfor.org/Tom/>

__Ride__: We have a handful of riders, but we’d really like more. Both rides are designed to be a challenge – but they are definitely doable. We feel that if we are asking folks to support us in our ride, we need to work hard to earn that support. If you are interested in riding, please contact us at <iridefortom@orbc4u.org> for more information. If you know someone who would like to ride with us, or should, please share this with them. In recognition of the time that the Craigs spent in Simpsonville, SC, we are specifically building plans to make it easier for any riders or volunteers from the Simpsonville area to come join us for the ride.

__Volunteer__: We are going to need support folks, workers at aid stations, help with the post-ride meal, etc. We also need folks to help spread the word and recruit others to donate. We know that the Craigs have impacted many folks over the past 30 years and – amazing as it is – not all of those folks are following my blog posts. We need folks like you to let those people know of the need and ask them to help out. If you want to volunteer to help organize or support the ride, please email us at <iridefortom@orbc4u.org>
