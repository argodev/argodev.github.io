The last “main” session I attended today was on extending the Visual Studio .NET IDE.  This session was of particular
interest to me as I’ve dabbled with the VSIP for quite some time now and never been able to get anything truly of
interest working.  I listened intently as they described the improvements in the VSIP (now the VS.NET SDK) in the
latest versions.  Key things are that they now support fully-managed packages… meaning I shouldn’t have to look at C++
(yeah!).  The wizards for add-ins are a little bit better now, and the registration process is greatly improved.  They
took us through two demos and answered a good number of questions.

After the session, I took some time and worked through one of the hands-on-labs available on this very topic and was
able to successfully get a dockable tool window sample working… maybe there is hope…

Of most interest is that after the sessions, many of the MSFT people are simply “around” for you to talk to… I was
able to spend a fair amount of time discussing some questions around multiple-tool-window interactions with the very
same guys that normally work on this stuff… it was a great opportunity and I’m appreciative of the time they spent with
me.
