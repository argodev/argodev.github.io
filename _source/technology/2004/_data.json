    "excerpt": "I've been contacted recently by a number of people regarding a recent scare about installing the service pack 1 for the .NET framework 1.1 on a system running MPS.  This issue has been fueled by the fact that Ensim had released a concern about the patch for their customers, and there have been a number of people reporting problems using the Configuration Wizard for MPS with the service pack.  So, let's get the facts out.",

The documentation and step-by-step examples have been a bit weak and the documentation for this area of the framework does not seem nearly as robust as other topics. This perception might be, however, just from my lack of true understanding of how this is all supposed to work and the associated terminology.",
