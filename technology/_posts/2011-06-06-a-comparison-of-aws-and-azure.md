This past weekend at [CodeStock](http://codestock.org/), I gave a double-length session that was a
side-by-side comparison of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Windows Azure. The objective was to
introduce the products, walk through the similarities and differences, and have a discussion around
where the different offerings fit various needs better than the other (or not).

The sessions were fairly well attended and we had some good conversations. The slides from both
sessions are provided below and, if you attended, I’d appreciate it if you’d also take a minute to
rate the sessions (button below) and provide feedback as to how they might be improved for the next
time.
