One of the ways I've been practicing my skills and working on forcing my head into the right 'space' is by participating in a handful of Capture-The-Flag (CTF) activities. My work so far has all been in the non-competition realm, but I find that it often introduces me to situations I would not have otherwise faced. Below are links to the write-ups/notes from some of the CTF/tutorials/trainings I've worked through. These are written primarily for my own benefit (forcing me to think through things) but may be of help to someone else. NOTE: these are all, by definition, spoilers. If you are learning and trying to grow, do yourself a favor, and do not just look at the answers.
