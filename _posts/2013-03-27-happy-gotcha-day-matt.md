It's hard to believe that it was five years ago today that Matt came to be part of our family forever. God has been so good to us. Matt has grown a ton in that time... it is hard to look at pictures of that big-haired 15-month old and realize it's the same child. Now, as a six year old, he's one of the most kind kids I know. He's incredibly outgoing and friendly - always concerned about making others feel at important. At home, he's been a great brother to baby R and has welcomed both B and D into our family even though he took the brunt of the changes.

One of the prayers that Julie and I have for Matt is that God would take him and use him in a special way for His glory. (As a probably biased father), it is a blessing to watch that prayer being answered earlier than I expected. As I write this, there are friends of ours who celebrated his 1-year gotcha day with us who realized that foster care and adoption were things that they could do too, and are now waiting for a child to be placed into their home.

We are excited to see how his life impacts others in the future and cannot be more grateful for the gift he is to us.
