I find that I often learn slowly. While this might surprise some who 
know me, I should differentiate between learning and interpreting as 
the latter I do quite quickly. I consider learning to be the solid 
aquisition of new skills or information, whereas interpreting is 
more often (in my world) a simple extension of existing the extant 
knowledge I have with new facts or scenarios. In this light, I have
set about learning what I can on the topic of Machine Learning and to
aid myself in this effort, I am going to take detailed notes as I
work through a few books. This is the first post in what I hope to 
be a series on the book titled "Machine Learning" by Sergios 
Theodoridis.
