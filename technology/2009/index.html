This quiet has the net-effect of allowing me to get quite a bit done. The last few days have been very productive with respect to our research project and Azure work (more on that coming soon) which is now in full swing. We are currently working on collecting performance data from our codes running in Azure (and soon in the Amazon cloud) and are also doing some testing of transfer speeds of data both to/from the cloud as well as between compute and storage in the cloud.</p><a href="/technology/2009/automated-chart-generation" class="btn btn-default">Continue Reading <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div><hr><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><a href="/technology/2009/windows-azure-climate-data-and-microsoft-surface"><h3>Windows Azure, Climate Data, and Microsoft Surface</h3></a><p><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></i> Posted on December 18, 2009  <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-comment"></i><span data-disqus-url="http://robgillen.com/technology/2009/windows-azure-climate-data-and-microsoft-surface" class="disqus-comment-count"></span> comments</p><p>I’ve been working on moving a large collection data to, from, and around Azure as we are testing the data profile for scientific computing and large-scale experiment post-processing and, in order to verify the data we uploaded and processed turned out as we wanted tit to, I built a simple visualization app that does a real-time query against the data in Azure and displays it. </p><a href="/technology/2009/windows-azure-climate-data-and-microsoft-surface" class="btn btn-default">Continue Reading <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div><hr><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><a href="/technology/2009/huntug-meeting-090914"><h3>HUNTUG Meeting 090914</h3></a><p><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></i> Posted on September 14, 2009  <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-comment"></i><span data-disqus-url="http://robgillen.com/technology/2009/huntug-meeting-090914" class="disqus-comment-count"></span> comments</p><p>I’ve been working for a bit on some larger-scale jobs targeting the Windows Azure platform and early last week had assembled a collection of worker roles that were supposed to be processing my datasets for a number of days moving forward.

Last week I found myself working with a SilverLight application to visualize the resulting data and display it to the user, however I did not want to use the ADO.NET Data Services client (ATOM) due to the size of data in transmission. Consequently, I set up a web role that proxied the data calls and fed them back to the caller as JSON.</p><a href="/technology/2009/silverlight-and-paging-with-azure-data" class="btn btn-default">Continue Reading <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div><hr><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><a href="/technology/2009/atompub-json-azure-and-large-datasets-part-2"><h3>AtomPub, JSON, Azure and Large Datasets, Part 2</h3></a><p><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></i> Posted on August 20, 2009  <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-comment"></i><span data-disqus-url="http://robgillen.com/technology/2009/atompub-json-azure-and-large-datasets-part-2" class="disqus-comment-count"></span> comments</p><p>Last Friday I posted some initial results from some simplistic testing I had done comparing pulling data from Azure via ATOM (the ADO.NET data services client) and JSON. I was surprised at the significant difference in payload and time to completion. A little later, Steve Marx questioned my methodology based on the fact that Azure storage doesn’t support JSON. Steve wasn’t being contrary, but rather pushing for clarification to the methodology of my testing as well as a desire to keep people from attempting to exploit the JSON interface of Azure storage when none exists.</p><a href="/technology/2009/atompub-json-azure-and-large-datasets-part-2" class="btn btn-default">Continue Reading <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div><hr><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><a href="/technology/2009/atompub-json-azure-and-large-datasets"><h3>AtomPub, JSON, Azure and Large Datasets</h3></a><p><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></i> Posted on August 14, 2009  <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-comment"></i><span data-disqus-url="http://robgillen.com/technology/2009/atompub-json-azure-and-large-datasets" class="disqus-comment-count"></span> comments</p><p>I’m just really beginning to scratch the surface on my work on cloud computing and scientific computing but it seems that nearly every day I’m able to spend time on this I come away with something at least moderately novel.

Firstly, Azure tables only allows you to return 1000 records in a given query. If you issue a query that has a larger matching result set, Azure will return some extra headers indicating as such (x-ms-continuation-NextPartitionKey and x-ms-continuation-NextRowKey).</p><a href="/technology/2009/silverlight-and-azure-table-data-paging" class="btn btn-default">Continue Reading <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div><hr><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><a href="/technology/2009/azure-blob-storage-blob-ids-and"><h3>Azure Blob Storage Blob IDs and “+”</h3></a><p><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></i> Posted on July 30, 2009  <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-comment"></i><span data-disqus-url="http://robgillen.com/technology/2009/azure-blob-storage-blob-ids-and" class="disqus-comment-count"></span> comments</p><p>I’d like to thank all of you who attended my session today at CodeStock.

It used to be that just providing personal web + email was all you had to do to be successful. Then, the “Application Service Provider” (ASP) model started and morphed into providing business-related services and eventually to where companies outsourced entire portions of their infrastructure (think Hosted Exchange, Hosted CRM, Hosted OCS).</p><a href="/technology/2009/clouds-and-traditional-hosting-companies" class="btn btn-default">Continue Reading <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div><hr><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><a href="/technology/2009/2009-bju-programming-contest"><h3>2009 BJU Programming Contest</h3></a><p><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></i> Posted on March 24, 2009  <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-comment"></i><span data-disqus-url="http://robgillen.com/technology/2009/2009-bju-programming-contest" class="disqus-comment-count"></span> comments</p><p>I had the privilege of being one of the alumni-judges at the annual Bob Jones University Computer Science departments programming contest.
