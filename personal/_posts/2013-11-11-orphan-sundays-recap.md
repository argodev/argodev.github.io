For the fourth year in a row, our local church family - Oak Ridge Baptist Church - set aside some time to consider the
scriptural mandate to care for the orphan and the fatherless. Our efforts were slightly more subdued this year due to
the overwhelming summer we have had, but I'm still quite thankful for the emphasis and the subsequent conversations we
have had.

On Sunday morning, November 2nd, my good friend Bob Roberts opened the Word and shared the Truth of our vertical
adoption and how it is often illustrated via horizontal adoption. I'd strongly encourage you to take the time to
listen to his message - it is available [here](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=CA99F1C887519C0%217107).

On Sunday evening, November 9th, I had the privilege of talking about some practical ways we can be involved as a
church family. The audio from that service is available
[here](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=CA99F1C887519C0%217106), and the slides are
