This is my first defcon.

I'm going to post a few things here about my experiences, primarily as a means of storing the data for my own purposes later on. Maybe it will be of some use to others.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with [defcon](http://defcon.org) it is a hacker conference that occurs in Las Vegas each year. It is not for the faint of heart, nor is it a place suitable for many people other than the target community. It is anonymous (don't use your real name). They take this so seriously, that there is no online registration - no logs, no nametags, no credit cards...  registration fees are paid in cash at the door.

This last part, incidentally, makes for a very long line on opening day... I entered the line at 8:08 this morning and exited with my badge at 9:45. Last year they had approximately 13,000 attendees with recent years averaging > 10,000. It should be interesting to see how tight things get tomorrow when the "main" portion of the conference starts.

As it was my first time here, I elected to attend the "Defcon 101" session. While there were some nuggets of value here, I personally found it generally waste of time. Essentially a group of guys on the stage seeing who had the bigger ego and who could swear the most. They certainly have a right to do this, and most of the crowd seemed to be enjoying it - it just seemed over the top for my taste. However, I did appreciate that while they were crude, they stressed the importance of being respectful to other attendees.

The primary take-aways from this session were:

1. have fun - get involved
2. even though this is a completely introverted crowd, make yourself talk to the people around you
3. be nice to people... mean people"stink"
4. oh... and be smart about what you are doing in the RF spectrum

Another thing I found interesting was the ban on photography. This doesn't mean it doesn't happen, but you are expected to ask permission prior to taking someone's picture. So much so, that a flash went off during a talk and the speaker stopped, made the guy stand up and proceeded to humiliate him in front of everyone. Given the crowd/purpose/etc, this makes sense... just seemed interesting to me.
