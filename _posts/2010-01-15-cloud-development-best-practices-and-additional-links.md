I noticed that [Amazon posted](http://jineshvaria.s3.amazonaws.com/public/cloudbestpractices-jvaria.pdf) a new white paper by Prashant Sridharan yesterday entitled “[Architecting for the Cloud: Best Practices](http://jineshvaria.s3.amazonaws.com/public/cloudbestpractices-jvaria.pdf)”. I pulled this down, read it, and wanted to pass it along to those who might have attended my talk yesterday as, while it is somewhat slanted to Amazon’s way of thinking, there are many sound and general concepts put forth in this doc and it is worth a read by anyone targeting the cloud. I do, however, find myself wondering, how long it will be until we can have a paper on cloud computing technologies without feeling the need to spend the first quarter of it justifying the premise (this is not a slam on the paper... more a reflection of the current state of things in the industry).

I also wanted to post a link to [Amazon’s AWS Security Whitepaper](http://awsmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf) as well as to their notice about having completed their [SAS70 Type II Audit](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2009/11/11/aws-completes-sas70-type-ii-audit/) in support of a conversation I had prior to the talk with a gentleman looking at cloud computing for some SLG clients he supports. Additionally, the link to the [government-focused cloud application site (apps.gov)](https://apps.gov/cloud/advantage/main/start_page.do) as well as to the introduction to the site provided in the webcast by US CIO Vivek Kundra.

Finally, I briefly discussed a whitepaper from MSR titled “[The Fourth Paradigm: Data-Intensive Scientific Discovery](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/fourthparadigm/default.aspx)” and wanted to provide the link to that as well.
