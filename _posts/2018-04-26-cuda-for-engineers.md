Last fall I did a [walk-through of a book on OpenCL]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/technology/2017/12/19/heterogeneous-computing-opencl2/). While I enjoyed the text and the walk-throughs, I found myself thinking that the tooling was a bit lacking. That drove me to want to dig in more to the current state of CUDA (NVIDIA's platform for high performance computing on graphics cards).

I decided to take a similar approach and to do a book walk-through. This time, I selected _CUDA for Engineers: An Introduction to High-Performance Parallel Computing_ due to its practical nature balanced with just enough theory to answer those "why does it work this way" questions. The book is [available on Amazon](http://amzn.to/2DH5Cw0) for those interested.

Much like the OpenCL book, I did a full walkthrough of the material, wrote up my thoughts as I was going along, and posted the notes and source code [on my GitHub repo](https://github.com/argodev/learn/tree/master/books/cuda_engineers)
