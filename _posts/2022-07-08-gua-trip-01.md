## Trip Rationale

Most of those who know us are aware that while all four of our children are adopted, the two oldest were international adoption cases and their birth-country is Guatemala. Back in 2006-2008, we made four trips to the capital city to visit and pick up our children, but in each case, we saw the airport, the local Marriott hotel, and the US Embassay. Due to cultural tensions regarding adoptions at that time, we were told not to stray from the hotel grounds. 

Our other two children were adopted through the foster care system here in Tennessee - their adoptive and birth culture are the same. For our two oldest, however, they have never been back to their birth country and we have been planning to return as an entire family for a number of years. Our goals for this kind of trip are somewhat simple: To reintroduce our oldest to their birth culture & country; to introduced our younger children to the culture of their siblings; for my wife and I to see more of this wonderful country; to learn about and serve those we come into contact with along the way. To this end, we had been planning on traveling with a local group that supports Guatemalan adoptees in the summer of 2020. We had purchased our tickets, made reservations, etc. Then, much like the rest of the world, plans were thwarted by COVID-19. We hoped to go in 2021, but the group we were planning to go with (wisely) determined that it was still to early to visit.

By the time this year came along, we were feeling significant pressure to take the trip before our kids got so old that it became impossible (or at least really difficult) to coordinate vacation/school/work schedules such that we could all go together. Our original group was still not planning to go, so we looked around a bit more and found an organization called [Our Guatemala](https://www.facebook.com/Our-Guatemala-Travel-with-Purpose-281969895276653/about). The details of the trip were a bit different, but it aligned with our goals and they were able to fit us in on the trip that was to travel 7/9-17/2022. We re-booked our tickets, made reservations, and begain preparing for what we hope will be the trip of a lifetime.

## Leaving a Day Early

We decided that rather than flying from Knoxville to Atlanta and then on to Guatemala, we would drive down to Atlanta, spend the night, and just fly from there. This had the advantage of saving some money, as well as giving as a direct flight - reducing the impacts of any flight delays. We spent most of the day preparing, packing and traveling from Knoxville to Atlanta. There was a lot of stress in the house as it seems that each person is nervous about various aspects of the trip, but are having a hard time expressing their feelings and/or thoughts (myself included).

We left the house mid afternoon and stopped to visit with some family (Julie's sister & her family) for dinner on the way. They really rolled out the red carpet for us and we felt like honored guests. The  Even better, Mich used it as an opportunity to teach Trey and Cora about hosting and preparing to have guests. Dinner consisted of grilled chicken, corn, salad, and watermelon followed by brownies with whip cream and strawberries. The food was great, the conversation light, and we left about 2 hours later having truly enjoyed ourselves. We filled up with gas and then drove about 40 minutes to the hotel.

After getting settled in, we all gathered in our room to discuss our plans for the next day. We walked through what it would be like at the airport (based on what we know) and tried to set expectations. We also went around the room and shared our concerns about the next day as well as what we were most excited about or anticipating. Finally, we asked the Maker to help allay our fears, calm our hearts, and give us rest that only He can. I am hopeful that tomorrow evening will give us opportunity to review the day and celebrate how God answered the prayers we had.
