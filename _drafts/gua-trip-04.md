Today is Bunkbed Day. Today we get up early to travel to the backyard schools program and learn about that work. Following that, we will head out into villages and deliver beds to families who desperately need them. We will be splitting into two groups this time as we have 33 beds to deliver! We learned yesterday that they have delivered over 4,000 beds since they started doing this program in 2015, and we are excited to be part of that number.

—-

We are now back at the hotel, and I’ve been emotionally destroyed. We delivered 16 beds today and each delivery was so fast, it was hard to process what all was happening - including the magnitude of the situation each family we met was in. My task today was to be the photographer for our group and I tried to capture the day as well as I could. As I went back through the ~350 pictures that I took, I found myself wishing that I could have spent much more time in each home… thinking about the situation, getting to know the folks we saw, playing with the children, etc. I feel like I missed *so* much of what is really going on… as if I subconsciously established a barrier that wouldn’t allow me to let myself see *reality*, as if it might break me, or be too much for my system to handle. 

From a purely pragmatic standpoint, I am a bit disappointed in my photography - I used the iPhone wide-angle lens a lot due to the incredibly small rooms we were in. Unfortunately, it is also not nearly as good for low-light situations as the primary camera sensor is. I wish I had brought an external wide-angle lens to attach on top of the primary and have just used that. 

After a few minutes of down-time back at the hotel, the kids wanted to go swimming so we went over to the larger pool at the hotel and hung out. Julie talked with a number of the other parents and I spent a lot of time editing and filtering the photos I had taken from the day.

Due to popular demand, the Guatemalan barber returned and gave another six hair cuts. This time Bobby got in the chair and, as you can see from the pictures, looks better than ever.

Immediately following we went to dinner at Aqua which is just about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. There we went to the roof top deck and took some pictures, after which we came down and settled into a wonderful dinner for our last evening in La Antigua.

I commented to Julie at dinner that I found it a bit dis-jointing. Here we were in a *beautiful* resturant, eating great food, being bothered that the one of the orders was taking longer than the others to arrive… and just five hours earlier we stood in a one-room tin shack and listened to a mother share how she barely has enough to care for her children, and often has to go hungry just to ensure that they get some food… At once I both despised myself (and those with me) whilst also being incredibly grateful for what God has given us. Striking a balance between giving all, giving some, caring for your family where you are, responding to proper promptings to give/serve, *not* living in perpetual guilt... I still have no idea of how to sort that all out. I left dinner still in a bit of turmoil, but also convinced that the struggle through this turmoil was a worthy one - that I and my family would be better for it.

Back at the hotel, we gathered as a family to discuss the day - what we saw, what we felt, what that means for us, etc. It was a good discussion and I’m glad we did it. We have two more days (Wednesday and Thursday) that I expect to be thought-provoking as we travel to Panahanchel and we will inter-mix a few down/fun days as well.
