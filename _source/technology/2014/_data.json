    "excerpt": "This week I spent a few days in Dallas, TX at the Crimes Against Children conference. I started to say \"I was privileged to attendâ€¦\" but I'm not certain that imparts the appropriate gravity to the conference. This week wasn't a party. It wasn't a \"good time\". It wasn't fun. It was work. Hard work. I found myself having to force myself to attend the sessions.",

    "excerpt": "We spent the past week with our extended family at a cabin in the TN mountains. We do this every year or so, and - as we normally do - we had a blast. On one of our \"in\" days, I had planned to work through an experiment with the kids to show the difference between the stock antenna for tracking airplanes via ADS-B and a custom-built antenna. We followed a number of online tutorials and used a bunch of open source software. I have posted below are the links for some of these tools and parts in case you want to do the same with your kids. I hope you have as much fun as we did!",

While I've worked with Azure from its inception, this is not an aspect of the platform that I have utilized, so I accepted - figuring I would have the opportunity to learn about a new (to me) aspect of a service I was already quite familiar with. I was provided with a copy of Learning Windows Azure Mobile Services for Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 ",
