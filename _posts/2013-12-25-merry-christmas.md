It's Christmas morning 2013 and, like most mornings, I find myself sitting in a
quiet house for a few hours while everyone else is sleeping. These times are
great as they allow me to reflect on how good God has been to me and my family.
Today is a little different than most mornings in that I find myself sitting
near a lit Christmas tree with many presents and stockings spread around. In
just a few hours, the kids will be running around, screaming with excitement and
trying very hard to not touch anything until everyone else arrives. It will be a
great day and, as a father, I enjoy little more than seeing pure joy on the face
of my children.

As I was sitting here thinking, I found myself convinced that I had already
received the best gifts I could have this season. The first is a simple
realization that it's been just over a year (12/21/2012) since Bobby and Dakota
came to live with us and _this_ Christmas, I am not watching two timid,
uncomfortable, I-know-I-don't-really-fit-in-and-want-to-be-somewhere-else kids,
but rather see a family that - while we look different from each other, could
not be closer. To our extended family, our friends, our church family, and to
God, I want to say a hearty "thank you" for loving on us, helping us, and being
part of helping these two boys become a full part of our family over the past
year.

The second gift is one that I didn't expect, and think I will sit with me for a
long time. The other night we had our just-our-family Christmas dinner and after
we read the Christmas story and we were talking a little about what Christmas
was really all about, I asked each of the kids to share something they were
thankful for. Erika piped up quickly with the following:

> I am thankful that you adopted me when I was little and gave me the best mommy
> and daddy and family - it was the best family for me and I'm thankful for
> that.

We often talk to the kids about how God has assembled our family in a unique
way, and often express our gratefulness for each and every person in our family,
but it was incredibly special to me to hear her verbalize it in such a clear and
heart-felt way.

It has also caused me to think about God, and a third ever-present gift... His
gift of salvation and Adoption into his family... when I didn't know what I
really needed or wanted, He adopted me into his family and gave me a gift far
beyond what I could have ever imagined.

God is good.... Merry Christmas from the Gillens
