## Halfway Point

Welcome to the half-way point of our trip. This was a "travel day" - the group moved from where we had been staying in La Antigua to Hotel Atitlan in Panajachel. Compared to yesterday, this was an *easy* day. We had plenty of time in the morning to get things together, so we decided that as a family we would pack up, enjoy a breakfast and walk around the hotel, and then look around town before we had to leave.

## Hotel Porta

I have been pleasntly surprised at how beautiful the hotel and its grounds are in La Antigua. After we finished breakfast, I stole away and grabbed a few more shots.

> I should note that *most* of the pictures I've been posting have been taken by me, on my iPhone. Some of them were taken by Matthew with his cell phone and some were provided by our trip leader (also using an iPhone). Many times on this trip I found myself wishing I had a high-end mirrorless camera with a couple of great lenses. That said, I think the phones did an OK job, all things considered.

After we finished packing, we headed out for some "just us Gillens" time around town. Antigua is a beautiful town and I think we could easily spend a few more days here.

## Travel and Pastores

Just before noon, we gathered as a group, loaded up the busses, and prepared to head out. Along the way, we stopped at a town named Pastores (quite close to Antigua), that sells all sorts of boots and other leather goods. It is so well known for this that there is a massive boot on the corner leading into town.

## Trip to Atitlan

With some shopping done, we settled in for the ~3 hour trip to Lake Atitlan. What follows is a collection of images that I selected to try to give you an idea of some of the countryside. It was *beautiful*, unique, different. During the trip, we climbed substantially (near 9,000 ft) and then dropped back down to around 5,500 feet at the lake. As you might imagine, cell phone pictures from inside a bus cannot do justice to the views we saw. Remember to click the pictures to get a full-screen view.

## Hotel Atitlan and Group Dinner

The hotel in Antigua was beautiful... the [hotel in Panajachel](https://www.hotelatitlan.com/) is beautiful in different ways. The rooms at the new hotel were not as unique or historical in their styling, but the gardens were amazing and the views across the water are hard to describe. I've included some pictures below and will continue to include some others taken on subsequent days. Once we settled in, we looked around a bit and then enjoyed a good meal and great conversation as a group at one of the largest tables I've seen.

One other difference between the two hotels is that this one catered more towards the tourist/restort-type person and we found ourselves surrounded by a rather loud group from the US that included a large number of ill-behaving teens. This group left the next day, and we rather enjoyed the remainder of our time at the hotel, but I was struck by the contrast to the teens that were with our group, and made a point of thanking them for conducting themselves so well and in a fashion that was respectful to those around them.

After dinner it was "off to bed" to get ready for our "day with Jose Miguel" tomorrow.
