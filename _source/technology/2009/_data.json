Our company has been working with hosters for many  years (I started in 2000 and they had been doing it before that) and have seen cycles of service come and go. It used to be that just providing personal web + email was all you had to do to be successful. Then, the “Application Service Provider” (ASP) model started and morphed into providing business-related services and eventually to where companies outsourced entire portions of their infrastructure (think Hosted Exchange, Hosted CRM, Hosted OCS).",

As with anything of this nature, there were a few bumps in the road, but nothing of any consequence",
