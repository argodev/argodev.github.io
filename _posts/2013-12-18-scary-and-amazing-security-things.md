I'm working on getting ready for my precompiler at [CodeMash](http://codemash.org/) in just a few weeks and I'm
incredibly excited. Last year I had a blast presenting along side Bill and talking with many in the developer and
security community.

This year, [Bill](https://twitter.com/sempf) is doing a talk Tuesday afternoon on Applied Application Security that
I'm quite excited to attend. You can learn more about the details of his talk here:
<http://www.sempf.net/post/Applied-Application-Security-at-CodeMash.aspx>

I will be giving a talk covering a number of security-related topics on Wednesday morning. I have the following items
on my list to discuss:

* Hiding in Plain Sight
* Passwords?
* Software Defined Radio & the Hacker
* How well do you know your Runtime?
* Open Discussion – how do *you* guarantee your machine isn’t compromised?

There are no pre-requsites for my talk other than an open and inquisitive mind. We will have a number of
demonstrations and will try not to adversely affect anyone else's talk :).

I hope you will consider joining me and participating - I look forward to seeing you there!
