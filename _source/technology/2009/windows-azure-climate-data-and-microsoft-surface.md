I’ve been working on moving a large collection data to, from, and around Azure as we are testing the data profile for
scientific computing and large-scale experiment post-processing and, in order to verify the data we uploaded and
processed turned out as we wanted tit to, I built a simple visualization app that does a real-time query against the
data in Azure and displays it. Originally the app was built as a simple WPF desktop application, but I got to thinking
that it would be particularly interesting on the Surface and therefore took a day or two to port it over. The video
below is a walkthrough of the app – the dialog is a bit cheesy but the app is interesting as it provides a very tactile
means of interacting with otherwise stale data.
