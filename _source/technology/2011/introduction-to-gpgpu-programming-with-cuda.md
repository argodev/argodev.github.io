This past weekend I had the honor of giving a talk at CodeStock 2011 here in Knoxville. This was the third year I’ve
participated in this conference and I really enjoy it. I decided to “step out” a bit and do a talk that was a bit
outside of my norm and tackle a topic of interest to me – GPU computing. The talk seemed to go OK, and there was some
good conversation in the room. The slides are provided below and, if you attended, I’d appreciate it if you’d take a
moment to rate the talk (button below) and provide feedback on how it might be improved for the next time. I’ve also
included a rough video of the session at the bottom for those who are interested.
