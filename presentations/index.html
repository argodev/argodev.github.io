Maybe you're a &quot;.NET developer&quot; and you've never really thought about them. In this session we'll discuss how attackers discover buffer overflows, how they interrogate them, and, finally, how they are exploited. We'll walk through a live demonstration from fuzzing through obtaining a remote shell. You'll leave with a better understanding of how they work, and why you should ensure your code is protected from them.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rgillen/anatomy-of-a-buffer-overflow-attack">Session Slides</a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo.com/44201782">Session Video</a></li></ul><h4>WiFu - so you think your wireless connection is safe?</h4><p>In this session we'll discuss various wireless security techniques including common misconceptions and mis-configurations. We will demonstrate how easy it is to compromise even &quot;secured&quot; connections and what the implications are for you as an IT professional. Using free software and inexpensive hardware (~$30), we'll demonstrate a number of attacks and highlight the vulnerabilities that are present in the behavior of many wireless devices.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rgillen/code-stock-wireless">Session Slides</a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo.com/44177323">Session Video</a></li></ul><h3>CodeMash 2.0.1.2</h3><h5>January 16, 2012</h5><a href="http://codemash.org">Conference Homepage</a><h4>Moving to the Cloud? (Migrating to Azure)</h4><p>You can hardly pick up a computer industry trade magazine without there being an article about cloud computing. Lots of people are talking about the cloud and it is likely your boss is thinking about it (whether you know it or not). However, many questions arise as soon as you begin to talk about the cloud. How do you get there? Does it even make sense for you? Should you move all of your applications to the cloud? If not, which ones? How do you even begin? This half-day session will address these questions by giving a brief introduction to Windows Azure - the Platform as a Service offering from Microsoft - and then, using hands-on-labs and real-world samples, dig into a practical approach to migrating your applications. The session will end with a discussion on scalability and practices you should consider as you look to make your move.</p><h3>Devlink 2011</h3><h5>September 5, 2011</h5><a href="http://devlink.net">Conference Homepage</a><h4>A Comparison of Windows Azure and Amazon Web Services</h4><p>Often when you talk with someone about cloud computing, or when you are evaluating the cloud for your application, the advice you get is slanted to one platform or the other. Generally, this is due to the fact that most cloud experts know a lot about their particular platform of choice and aren't overly familiar with other offerings. Join us as we take a side-by-side walk through the features of both the Amazon and Microsoft offerings, and discuss various strengths and weaknesses of the platforms as well as their similarities and distinctives.</p><ul><li><a href="">Session Slides</a></li></ul><h4>Introduction to GPGPU Development using CUDA</h4><p>Much has been made in recent years about the multi-core explosion and the paradigm shift that developers are facing. In concert with this change, we are seeing a dramatic increase in the use of hybrid architectures (combination of traditional CPU and specialized processing boards). The most common combination of hybrid architecture is the CPU and GPU. In this session we'll provide an introduction to writing code to run on the GPU, we'll look at developer tools in Visual Studio to assist in this process, and we'll discuss various applications and approaches to consider when looking to leverage the GPU in your applications.</p><ul><li><a href="">Session Slides</a></li></ul><h3>CodeStock 2011</h3><h5>June 7, 2011</h5><a href="http://www.codestock.org">Conference Homepage</a><h4>A Comparison of Windows Azure and Amazon Web Services</h4><p>Often when you talk with someone about cloud computing, or when you are evaluating the cloud for your application, the advice you get is slanted to one platform or the other.
