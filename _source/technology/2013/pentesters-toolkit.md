The second session I attended was called the Pentesters Toolkit and was designed to walk us through the "bag" that a
seasoned pentester carries with him on most any job. This was very practical and I enjoyed the session. More
interesting to me, was that my normal "kit" includes nearly everything mentioned.

Some of the items mentioned were:

* Consider using a photography bag... they are nice due to the internal dividers that can be rearranged for your gear.
Also have some "quick entry" panels that make it easy to grab the stuff you need in a hurry.

* carry a second (USB) ethernet adapter

* network switch

* WiFi Pineapple

* multiple WiFi adapters

* multiple VMs with multiple OSes - don't stick to just one... understand where each shines and use the appropriate one
for the given task

* Favors Nessus over other scanners (Qualys, Nexpose)

* Favors Pentoo over Kali/Backtrack but really pushed manually installing the tools... you need to know your toolkit
and its dependencies... don't just click menus (I strongly agree)

One of the most salient things mentioned, was "know your audience" - which is simple, but extremely important. There a
re times where you want to convey your hacker cred and are working with the "boots on the ground" - here walking in
with your case/laptop covered with stickers, dressing with a colored mohawk might be great. However, there are also
times where you might be presenting to the corporate leaders and a suit and a plain/conservative approach is more
likely to yield the desired affects.

During the Q&A time at the end, someone asked him how to become a good/proper pentester. I really appreciated his
answer: "Learn how to be a great defender." He went on to say that once you learned how to properly defend a network,
you would be well trained on how to pick apart a network. He claimed that very few good pentesters go directly into the
attack/offensive side (although many bad ones do).
