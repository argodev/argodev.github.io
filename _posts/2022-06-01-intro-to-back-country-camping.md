description: "For quite some time, we have talked about going back-country camping. For most of the past 12 years, we have gone camping at least once but this would be classified as \"car-camping\". You go to a state or national park, you have a campsite that has a parking spot right next to your designated tent area and fire pit. There is a bath house not too far away, and there exist many trails and other activities to keep you busy. We've always done this as tent camping, but there is a level of safety knowing that if things get bad, or you forgot something, you can always hop in the car and run to the store (or home)."

For quite some time, we have talked about going back-country camping. For most of the past 12 years, we have gone camping at least once but this would be classified as "car-camping". You go to a state or national park, you have a campsite that has a parking spot right next to your designated tent area and fire pit. There is a bath house not too far away, and there exist many trails and other activities to keep you busy. We've always done this as tent camping, but there is a level of safety knowing that if things get bad, or you forgot something, you can always hop in the car and run to the store (or home). 

Back country camping is different in that you put everything you need for your entire trip in a backpack (one for each camper) and you leave your vehicle behind, only to see it some days later at the end of the trip. If you forgot something... too bad. Need water? carry it in, or find some. Want to start a fire? Find some fallen wood and chop it up into reasonably-sized firewood. 

## Our First Trip

So, with the oldest three away for the week serving at [camp](https://www.cbmcamp.com/) Dakota and I decided to "level-up" our camping experience and see what the back-country is all about.  We have dreams of doing long distances and multi-day trips, but we thought we should probably start off with something more manageable (and safe). For this, we crafted a 48-hour trip in [Frozen Head State Park](https://tnstateparks.com/parks/frozen-head) that would have us stay in two different back-country sites. Each day's hiking was purposefully kept to a reasonable distance so we could take our time and adjust to carrying full packs. 

## Day 1

We started off the day at home with a traditional breakfast from our car-camping days: tortilla egg scramble. There's nothing fancy going on here, but it's kind of tradition and got us both ready to go.

Today's hike had us starting at the trailhead and hiking a little over 2.6 miles and climbing just over 1000 feet to the North Old Mac camp site. I've included the elevation profile below as well as an embedded map of the hike.

Once we arrived at the site, things were great. We enjoyed some amazing views, interesting critters, and plenty of privacy. This site did not have a water source, so we packed in two liters of water each. The expectation was that this would give us enough water for the hike up, to cook dinner, breakfast, and the hike the next day. Dinner was a couple of Mountain House meals and some Oreos. Breakfast was oatmeal and instant coffee. Meals and snacks worked out perfectly.  We slept without rain tarps and went to sleep watching fireflies dance in the trees around us. I've included some pictures below.

## Day 2

Day 2 started off great. The sun rose over the ridge and came through the trees as we woke and got ready for the day. Once we had breakfast and packed up camp, had a short ~2 mile hike (784' of climbing) to the fire tower for lunch. We spent some time at the top of the tower enjoying the view and reading books before eating lunch and beginning the second part of the hike.

Once we finished at the fire tower, we hiked a short 0.4 miles down to Tub Springs to refill our water bottles from the spring there. We were told that Coffin Springs *should* have a water source, but it may not be running. To be safe, we decided to fill up at the spring we knew had water. This done, we hiked the remaining ~2.5 miles to the Coffin Springs campsite. This was a mostly neutral hike with only 260 feet of ascent. Interestingly, the last 0.7 miles of the hike were on a part of the trail that has clearly not been traveled nearly as much as the majority of the trails we've seen in the park. Unlike the first night, the campsite was not private - the trail actually crosses directly through the middle of the campsite. Fortunately, this is a rather quiet section of the park (the park boundary fence is right along the side of the campground) and we only saw one person come through - and he was coming off five days hiking the [Cumberland Trail](https://tnstateparks.com/parks/cumberland-trail) - he said we were the first people he had seen. 

Once we arrived and got settled, Dakota wasted no time hunting for critters and had a blast. There was water close and *lots* of living things. Not long after, he found a small waterfall that contained its own world of living creatures. Back at the campground, we cooked dinner and spent most of the evening talking and playing cards around the fire.

## Day 3

By the morning of the third day, we were both ready to be home. We woke to another beautiful sunrise, prepared our breakfast, and then struck camp. The hike out was the longest hike (6 miles) but was mostly downhill. We did stop off at another campsite to check it out as a potential for future visits and spent some time at one last waterfall and rock formation to look for some more critters. Here we confirmed that the _"pinchers on the small crawdads hurt more than the big ones"_.

## Wrap-Up

We had a great time, and are already planning our next adventure. We decided to commemorate this trip with a sticker for each of the participants. Because of Dakota's penchant for the outdoors, I thought the following would be rather appropriate:
