<p>A <a href="http://it.toolbox.com/people/ebegoli/">colleague of mine</a> sent me <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21628875.500-cassette-tapes-are-the-future-of-big-data-storage.html">a link to this story</a>
about using cassettes for storing data and asked for my thoughts. This was clearly a good-natured jab at me in light of a prior
conversation we had debating the appropriateness of tape or disk for a research data storage platform. I had been
arguing against tape as an out-moded and inappropriate storage mechanism.</p>
<p>The problem is… I was <strong><em>wrong</em></strong>.</p>
<p>And so was he.</p>
<p>I am using the word “wrong” not in the moral sense but to mean “less than the ideal”, “unfortunate”, “sad”,
“depressing”, <enter your own term here>.</enter></p>
<p>You see, I was wrong in that as he argued (and is well articulated in the article) there is simply too much data being
generated to make disks a tractable solution. Even with
<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9227382/60TB_disk_drives_could_be_a_reality_in_2016">recent and projected growth in hard drives</a>
(60TB expected by 2016) our ability to produce data – particularly in an automated means via sensors and scientific
instruments – already does, and will continue to out-pace these advancements. Even if hard drives were able to keep up
with the space demands, the power required to keep those drives running quickly becomes prohibitive. And let’s not even
talk about disk transfer rate issues.</p>
<p>Whether or not <em>he</em> was “wrong” is probably a bit more subjective (an admission I’m certain he’ll enjoy). My
frustration with his position is that it tends to be synonymous with “slow” or “laborious”. That said, an unfortunate
reality in the digital sciences is that with data sets of any significant size, a researcher often has to plan well in
advance of his experiment to stage the data. Data has to be loaded into online storage from some cold storage mechanism
(often a tape library). This significantly limits one’s curiosity and causes some questions to go unanswered (i.e.
“I wonder if… well, it’s probably not worth the time/effort to load up the data just to see…”).  I suppose that if I’m
honest, I’m simply manifesting the “Google effect” – the expectation that I can as a question of tons of data and get
an answer instantly. I’d love for this to be possible of all scientific data – but as any data scientist will tell you,
that desire is simply naïve. Providing platforms such as Google’s is hard work, and not achieved without significant
planning and effort. Admitting this still doesn’t mean I can’t hope for it…</p>
<p>The real nugget buried in the article and underlying our friendly debate, is that storage technologies are nowhere
close to where we need them to be. No matter which option we choose it will be a compromise between a.) discarding
data – unfortunate no matter how you look at it, b.) spending astronomical amounts of money on both hardware and power,
or  c.) using slow, offline, and deterioration-prone devices such as tapes. Frankly, none of these options are
attractive. There is a little part of me that dies when I think of a researcher having to choose to <em>discard</em> data
simply because he doesn’t have space to store it and doesn’t currently think it is important to his work. What if he’s
wrong? What if that data is (or was) the key to solving part of the problem, he just didn’t know it yet? Or maybe it is
the key to solving a problem he doesn’t yet know he has…</p>
<p>So here’s hoping that the researchers working on storage technologies will be successful. That they will develop means
and methods for us to store massive amounts of data, access it in increasingly shorter times, and with a power envelope
that is reasonable and sustainable.  That’s not asking too much, is it?</p><!--a(href='#{ conf.web_link }') Conference Homepage--><!--each session in conf.sessions--><!--  .row--><!--    .col-xs-11--><!--      h4 #{ session.title }--><!--      p #{ session.abstract }--><!--      if session.assets--><!--        ul--><!--          each asset in session.assets--><!--            li--><!--              a(href='#{ asset.link }') #{ asset.title }--></div></div><hr><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-sm-3"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading">Recent Posts</div><div class="panel-body"><ul><li><a href="/technology/2014/you-cant-handle-the-truth">You Can't Handle The Truth</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2014/codestock-2014">CodeStock 2014</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2014/tracking-planes-on-vacation">Tracking Planes on Vacation</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2014/book-review-learning-windows-mobile-services-for-win-8-and-win-phone-8">Book Review: Learning Windows Mobile Services for Win 8 and Win Phone 8</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2014/codemash-2014">CodeMash 2014</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading">Older Posts</div><div class="panel-body"><ul><li><a href="/technology/2014/">2014 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2013/">2013 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2012/">2012 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2011/">2011 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2010/">2010 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2009/">2009 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2008/">2008 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2007/">2007 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2006/">2006 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2005/">2005 Posts</a></li><li><a href="/technology/2004/">2004 Posts</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="container"><p class="text-muted credit"><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png"></a> This work is licensed under a<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.</p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.1.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/site.js"></script></body></html>
