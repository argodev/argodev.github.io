After the late dinner last night, the parents in the group were contemplating staging a mini revolt and sleeping in a bit today, but we all still made it to the water taxies by 9. From there, we took a short boat ride to [Kayak Guatemala](https://kayakguatemala.com/) for a day of rest and relaxation.

We had some brief introductions and then all headed off in kayaks for a 40 minute ride to a little nook on the lake where the kids could swim and do a little cliff jumping.

Much to my surprise, *all* of my kids participated in the cliff jumping, Julie and I were quite proud of each of them for doing something that required them to overcome their fears. Dakota, of course, jumped multiple times, but everyone else was one-and-done. It was pretty cool to watch them  do the jumps and all seemed to enjoy the experience. Below are short clips of both Dakota and Bobby jumping as they give a pretty good idea of what the experience was like (at least from an observer's point of view).

As we made our way back to the kayak rental shop, we learned just how much of head-wind we had enjoyed on our ride over. It was a much harder paddle back, but we enjoyed it and were rewarded with lunch shortly after our return. Once again, the meal was amazing. Fresh vegetables, pork and chicken tacos, rice, beansâ€¦ it was great. We spent another hour or so after lunch playing games on the grounds after which we took the boat taxies back to the hotel where the majority of the group descended on the pool area for games and relaxation before dinner.

After dinner we headed off to bed as tomorrow we travel back to Antigua and begin to "wrap up" this trip.
