Because the keynote went long today, they rescheduled the lunch sessions so my second session of the day was called
Windows Communications Foundation ("Indigo"): A Lap around the Windows Communications Foundation. Unfortunately, I felt
the session was nearly a complete waste of time.  Besides the fact that the speaker seemed less than prepared (truly
seemed surprised by some of his demo results), the demo and content did not “gell” well.  There wasn’t that cohesion
that makes for a good presentation.  Furthermore, while I came out of the presentation knowing how to do some WCF
programming, I am still missing the *why* I would want to.  Seeing that this was the introductory session of the
conference on Indigo, I assumed more time would have been spent on getting us excited about why we would want to use
this new technology, and the amazing business problems it could solve for us… unfortunately, none of that was given.
Thankfully, this was the only “downer” session I attended today.
