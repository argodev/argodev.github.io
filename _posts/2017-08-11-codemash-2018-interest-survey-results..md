Each year as we enter into the CodeMash CFP, we solicit feedback from the community to see what they are interested in hearing about in the coming conference. We provide this information in aggregate to the folks submitting talks as well as use it as input to our content selection process. Each year, the results are both helpful and ... interesting. A few examples:

> C# is still a thing. Cloud content would be cool to see.

> Less Intro to / 101 level sessions. Most information like this can be easily found online.

> More advanced level sessions containing information not easily found online.

> GET /topics/missing/1 200 -> { title: "API Design and Development" }

> Speakers who fly-in, talk, leave - they kill the regional sense of community.

> less javascript frameworks, more esoteric languages and technology! people can learn react or angular anywhere, they should come to codemash to be inspired by new ideas and concepts!

> JS! React! Node! Ruby! Rails! Accessibility! Usability! TDD!

> last year the topics of interest didn't correlate to interest. the hardware if talks were low in the interest survey, but were the most well attended. (This is not incorrect)

> Can Brian Prince wear rainbow-colored hair?


If you will indulge me, I'd like to provide a few responses to the above from my vantage point on the content committee:

* Much to the disbelief of many, we work very hard to balance the content based on the interest expressed (in surveys such as this, in the relative volume of sessions submitted, etc.) as well as our own following of industry trends. We intentionally have technical and industry diversity on the committee to help ensure that no one company/technology/stack is over-represented.

* There were a few comments regarding the lack of variety in the languages represented over the past few years - specifically Java and Python. As the one person who reviews every single submission (yes, I do) I can say that those languages were quite under-represented in the volume and quality of submissions as compared to other languages. We did have both Java and Python talks last year, and I would agree that we didn't have as many of either as I would have liked. In both cases however, considering the number of sessions included in the conference for those technlogies they were _overrepresented_ relative to the submission count. For those wondering, we do not base our selection distribution purely on submission count, but it is one of the demand signals we consider.

* Finally, if you find the matieral slim in a given area, __please__ consider submitting an abstract or two yourself. We desire breadth and diversity in the content. Also, if you are aware of someone who is a knowledgeable on a topic you are interested in, encourage them to submit a talk. That is one of the best ways for us to broaden our speaker and content base (hint JVM, Python).

## The Results
Finally, the part that folks have been looking for... the summation of the results from the survey. The survey had 374 responses. For those who care, the methodology applied is as follows:

* One vote for a topic as a "most interested" earns 1 point.
* One vote for a topic as a "second most interested" earns 0.75 points.
* One vote for a topic as a "third most interested" earns 0.5 points.
* One vote for a topic in the "please do less of this topic so you can do more of the ones I care about" subtracts 0.25 points.

## Analysis
There was some movement in the categories this year... 

- Architecture moved from second to first
- Programming Principles dropped to third after Web/Front-End
- DevOps moved up from 9th to 4th
- Design (UI/UX) moved into the 6th slot (up from #9)
- Mobile dropped four slots
- Hardware moved up and Enterprise/Large-Shop is now in last place.
