Today is a sick-day, which means I have an abnormal amount of time to hang around and read stuff online and to think about it... some friends on FB posted a video (below) that hit me squarely between the eyes.

I won't soften it - it is hard to watch - it is hard to feel what this girl feels... what each person in the film feels

I can't help but think of how many people on FB might repost/re-share the video without realizing how many times this happens around them each week - this is not a far-off thing... it happens in and around our neighborhoods each week. We need to stop sharing / liking / whatever on FB and start opening our homes to these kids. We need to love as He loved us
