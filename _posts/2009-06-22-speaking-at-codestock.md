I’m privileged to have been given the opportunity to speak at 
[CodeStock](http://codestock.org) (details below) this coming Friday. I’ll be 
speaking on the topic of Deploying and Packaging SharePoint solutions using TFS. 
The abstract for my session is:

> Have you been using the VS Extensions for SharePoint to create SharePoint 
> packages and found yourself wondering how best to integrate with your source 
> control platform and build system? Consistent packaging of SharePoint 
> solutions can be a challenge and is not for the faint of heart. Come to this 
> session and learn how our team utilizes TFS, Team Build, SandCastle, 
> SharePoint Installer, and STSDev in concert to produce consistent installation 
>packages for our SharePoint/MOSS environment.

[CodeStock](http://codestock.org) is about Community. For Developers, by 
Developers (with love for SysAdmins and DBAs too!). Last year an idea started at 
CodeStock to mix Open Spaces within a traditional conference. This year we're 
going to crank things up to 11 and rip off the knob - and you're being drafted 
to help!

* Keynote by Microsoft RIA Architect Evangelist Josh Holmes
* From Developer to Business Owner roundtable with guest Nick Bradbury creator 
of HomeSite, TopStyle, and FeedDemon
* 50+ break out sessions + Open Spaces (self-organizing sessions)
* Grand Prize: VSTS 2008 Team Suite with MSDN Premium
* Virtual sessions with Jeffery Richter and John Robbins

Space is limited so register today at [CodeStock.org](http://codestock.org)
