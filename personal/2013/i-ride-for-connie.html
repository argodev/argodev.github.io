<p>I&#39;ve been meaning to post this for quite some time but have been waiting until I had worked out the details (at least mentally).
Things are coming together enough and its getting close enough on the calendar that we need to get this public.</p>
<p>Each of the past three years, I have participated in a long bike ride in honor of my Mother-in-law, Ann Black, who passed away
in April of 2010 after struggling for years with complications from a fight with cancer and diabetes. Her spirit of
fighting/unwillingness to give up is the reason that I&#39;ve chosen to do the ride in a time of the year that is unpopular and hot.
While not impossible rides, they have been tributes to Ann’s spirit of fighting even when it was tough. She completed her course
and didn&#39;t give up.</p>
<p>This year, I am combining my desire to ride in Ann’s honor with a cause that is of incredible importance to my family – the
cause of orphans around the world. This year, in conjunction with a number of organizations and people, we will be riding to
raise money to help bring Connie home to her forever family.</p>
<p>Connie is almost 10 years old, has Down syndrome, and is currently an orphan in China.  The wonderful thing is that this is not
the end to Connie’s story. You see, a couple of years ago, God began working in the lives of the Walters family and burdened
their hearts for children with special needs who had been abandoned and needed a family. In August of 2011, the Walters welcomed
home James Ivan – a then four-year old with Down syndrome who was living in an orphanage in a remote village in Russia. Not long
after James arrived home, we had the privilege of spending some time with the Walters and they expressed their interest in
adopting again. At this point they had three children and God was leading them to show His love to another. Recently their
prayers have been answered and they are proceeding with the adoption of Connie. If you know anything about international adoption,
you likely have an idea of how expensive it is – generally between 25 and 40 thousand dollars. The Lord has already opened many
doors and the cost has been reduced significantly, but they still need to raise quite a bit of money. Our goal is to raise at least
$2,500 to help bring Connie home.</p>

<h2>How can you help?</h2><ol>
<li><p>Support a RiderJoin the Ride: The ride is going to occur on September 7, 2013 in Knoxville, TN and will be a metric
century (100 Km or roughly 63 miles). The ride will be supported via volunteers and we are going to attempt to make the ride
accessible to a wide range of skill sets. We are asking each rider to try to raise at least $250 in funds. If you are interested
in riding, please let me know via the contact link above.</p>

<li><p>Support a rider. The best way is to visit the page at <a href="http://idoitfor.org/connie">http://idoitfor.org/connie</a>. Here you can support a rider, and even

<p>I’m a big fan of the <a href="http://idoitfor.org">I Do It For</a> organization. Their motto captures my desire to help Connie and others
and clarifies why I’m doing a directly-focused ride rather than participating in a generic ride for a good (but somewhat
anonymous) cause.</p>
