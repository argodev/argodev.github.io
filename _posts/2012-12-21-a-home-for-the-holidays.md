Today is a big day… probably one that I didn’t think would come or didn’t think would happen to us. Today we
welcome two young boys (B: 4 and D: 2) into our home as foster kids. Not for respite care, or a temporary
placement this time, but as long as they need it. Today is also the night we celebrate our family Christmas
before we start traveling to visit others… this seems somehow fitting.

“Excited” is probably an understatement… as is nervous, anxious, insane, and a host of other words. “Blessed”
is likely the most accurate. I saw yesterday a post on twitter from Tim Keller that said “The deeper the
experience of the free grace of God, the more generous we must become.” This well explains why we are involved,
and why we participate in foster care… God has been so amazingly good to us, we can’t help but respond… and for
us, this is how we feel he’d have us do it.

The weight of today is not lost on us either… the act of adding two people to a family is a non-trivial change.
Things cost more… travelling is more challenging… fitting everyone (and their stuff) into a car is not as easy,
finding a table at a restaurant is harder. More seriously, the challenge of being the physical representation of
God’s Father-like love – and all it entails – is overwhelming. Thankfully, we know His grace is amazing and He
gives us strength to do what He calls us to when we need it.

All of that understood, I still can’t get away from the feeling that we’ve been given an early Christmas present…
