## Introduction


## Books of Interest

* [The C Programming Language](https://amzn.to/3bV3S0q), Brian Kernighan, Dennis Ritchie. This is an older book, but is considered "the bible of the C language". I am not sure you could claim to study/know the C language without having spent time with this book.
