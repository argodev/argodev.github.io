I’m thrilled to be speaking at the CodeMash Precompiler next week. I’m going to be joined by
[Mike Wood](http://mvwood.com/) and helped by [Brian Prince](http://www.brianhprince.com/) and
[Michael Collier](http://michaelcollier.wordpress.com/). Together, we’ll have nearly 8 hours of instruction and hands
on labs covering both the Amazon and Microsoft cloud computing platforms. Below I’ve listed the abstracts for each of
the sessions as well as the prerequisites for those planning on joining us. If you are going to be in Sandusky next
Wednesday, be sure to drop by.

####An Introduction to Amazon Web Services (half-day, afternoon)

AWS has been in the cloud computing space longer than most anyone, and they are the de-facto standard when it comes to
Infrastructure as a Service. While most developers are comfortable with the notion of virtual machines, reviewing the
AWS offering can sometimes look like alphabet soup (EC2, S3, SNS, SDB, SQS). Join us to learn the power behind these
acronyms and the tools that they can provide your next project. We'll discuss the major components, some of the
trade-offs between different implementation choices (i.e. boot from S3/boot from EBS, etc.) and provide you with the
opportunity to work through some labs, deploy some code, and begin to experience the Amazon cloud for yourself.

Examples are in .NET, but fundamental concepts apply to all platforms.


####An Introduction to Windows Azure (half-day, morning)

Steve Ballmer has made it very clear that Microsoft is "all in" when it comes to the cloud and by now most have heard
about Microsoft's Windows Azure platform... but what does that mean for you? Whether you are an experienced .NET
developer who is wondering what all this cloud stuff means for how you write code, or maybe you are a traditional
\*nix developer looking to understand how to integrate your existing code with the Microsoft version of the cloud, join
us for an in-depth discussion on what Platform as a Service is, how Microsoft has implemented it, what scenarios it
best addresses, and a collection of hands-on-labs to get you started.

Examples are in .NET, but fundamental concepts apply to all platforms.


####Prerequisites

The sessions will be part presentation, part hands on labs.  While you aren't required to bring a laptop, you'll get
much more out of the sessions if you have one available to work through the labs with (but, there might be some people
willing to pair as well!).  Please make sure to bring your power cord!

Here are the prerequisites to have loaded:

#####An Introduction to Windows Azure

* Operating Systems Supported: Windows 7 (Ultimate, Professional, and Enterprise Editions); Windows Server 2008;
Windows Server 2008 R2; Windows Vista (Ultimate, Business, and Enterprise Editions) with either Service Pack 1 or
Service Pack 2

* [Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (full version or the free trial)](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio).

* [SQL Server 2005 Express Edition (or above) (this is usually installed with Visual Studio)](http://www.microsoft.com/express/sql/download)

* [Install the Windows Azure Tools for Microsoft Visual Studio (and some hotfixes)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsazure/cc974146.aspx)

* [Install the AppFabric SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=39856a03-1490-4283-908f-c8bf0bfad8a5&displaylang=en)

* [Install the Windows Azure Platform Training Kit](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=413E88F8-5966-4A83-B309-53B7B77EDF78&displaylang=en)

#####An Introduction to Amazon Web Services

* [Amazon AWS SDK for .NET](http://d1q6xku6craafi.cloudfront.net/AWSSDKForNET_1.2.0.2.msi)

  * Requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/default.aspx) 2.0 or later.

* Use the AWS SDK for .NET with any of the following Visual Studio editions:

  * [Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Professional Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/) or later

  * [Microsoft Visual C# 2008 Express Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/express/vcsharp/) (free!)

  * [Microsoft Visual Web Developer 2008 Express Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/express/vwd/) (free!)

You might be thinking, "Hey, What a second!  This is CodeMash, you just listed all Microsoft tools there!".  Just like
CodeMash, both Windows Azure and Amazon AWS are happy to mix in multiple development stacks.  Our labs and demos will
be shown using Visual Studio, but don't let that stop you from following along or trying out the cloud platforms from
your Mac, or using Java, PHP and Ruby on Windows.  Below are links to other SDKs for each cloud platform.  Please,
feel free to explore your options and load these SDKs or libraries up if you prefer them.
